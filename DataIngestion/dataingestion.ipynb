       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'speech.txt'}, page_content='The world must be made safe for democracy. Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty. We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them.\\n\\nJust because we fight without rancor and without selfish object, seeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples, we shall, I feel confident, conduct our operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and of fair play we profess to be fighting for.\\n\\nâ€¦\\n\\nIt will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus, not in enmity toward a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck. We are, let me say again, the sincere friends of the German people, and shall desire nothing so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between usâ€”however hard it may be for them, for the time being, to believe that this is spoken from our hearts.\\n\\nWe have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that friendshipâ€”exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible. We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions toward the millions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy who live among us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it toward all who are in fact loyal to their neighbors and to the government in the hour of test. They are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance. They will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose. If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with with a firm hand of stern repression; but, if it lifts its head at all, it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few.\\n\\nIt is a distressing and oppressive duty, gentlemen of the Congress, which I have performed in thus addressing you. There are, it may be, many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us. It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our heartsâ€”for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.\\n\\nTo such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured. God helping her, she can do no other.')]"

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOverview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\n\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\n\\nExamples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\n\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\n\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\n\\nExperiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\n\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\n\\nAfter fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\n\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\n\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\n\\nComparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration.

I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCategorization of human memory.\\n\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\n\\nComparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\n\\nA picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\n\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\n\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\n\\nPseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\n\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\n\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

A large language model (e.g., Open AI’s GPT-4, Meta’s \\nLLaMa, Google’s PaLM) is a machine learning algorithm that scans \\nenormous volumes of text to learn which words and sentences \\nfrequently appear near one another and in what context. Large language \\nmodels can be adapted to perform a wide range of tasks across different \\ndomains. They are most known for being used to build chatbots, \\nsuch as ChatGPT, but researchers and technology companies also \\nuse them for content analysis tasks, such as sentiment analysis, text \\nsummarization, and hate speech detection. Google, Meta, Microsoft, \\nand other companies have already incorporated large language models \\ninto their core product functions, such as content moderation and \\nsearch. Other vendors soon may incorporate them into automated \\ndecision-making systems, such as resume scanners.\\nRecently though, researchers and technology companies have attempted \\nto extend the capabilities of large language models into languages other \\nthan English by building what are called multilingual language models. \\nInstead of being trained on text from only one language, multilingual \\nlanguage models are trained on text from dozens or hundreds of \\nlanguages at once. Researchers posit that multilingual language models \\ninfer connections between languages, allowing them to apply word \\nassociations and underlying grammatical rules learned from languages \\nwith more text data available to train on (in particular English) to \\nthose with less. In some applications, multilingual language models \\noutperform models trained on only one language — for instance, a \\nmodel trained on lots of text from lots of languages, including Hindi, \\nmight perform better in Hindi contexts than a model just trained on \\nHindi text.\\nMultilingual language models give technology companies a way to scale \\ntheir AI systems to many languages at once, and some have already \\nbegun to integrate them into their products. Online service providers \\nin particular have deployed multilingual language models to moderate \\nLost in Translation\\nCDT Research\\n6\\ncontent: Meta uses a multilingual language model to detect harmful content on its \\nplatforms in over 100 languages; Alphabet’s Perspective API uses one to detect toxic \\ncontent in eighteen different languages; Bumble uses one to detect and take action on \\nunwanted sexual messages around the world.\\nMultilingual language models allow technologists to attempt to build models in languages \\nfor which they otherwise might not have enough digitized text. Languages vary widely \\nin resourcedness, or the volume, quality, and diversity of text data they have available to \\ntrain language models on. English is the highest resourced language by multiple orders of \\nmagnitude, but Spanish, Chinese, German, and a handful of other languages are sufficiently \\nhigh resource enough to build language models in. Medium resource languages, with fewer \\nbut still high-quality data sets, such as Russian, Hebrew, and Vietnamese, and low resource \\nlanguages, with almost no training data sets, such as Amharic, Cherokee, and Haitian \\nCreole, have too little text for training their own large language models. Language data in \\nlow resource languages is also often of particularly poor quality: either it is mistranslated or \\neven nonsensical language scraped from the internet, or is limited to sources with narrow \\ndomains, such as religious texts and Wikipedia. This gap in data availability between \\nlanguages is known as the resourcedness gap.\\nMultilingual language models are designed to address these gaps in data availability by \\ninferring semantic and grammatical connections between higher- and lower-resource \\nlanguages, allowing the former to bootstrap the latter. However, this architecture \\nraises its own concerns. Multilingual language models are still usually trained \\ndisproportionately on English language text and thus end up transferring values and \\nassumptions encoded in English into other language contexts where they may not \\nbelong. For example, a multilingual model might associate the word “dove” in all \\nlanguages with “peace” even though the Basque word for dove (“uso”) can be an insult. \\nThe disparity in available data also means multilingual language models work far better \\nin higher resource languages and languages similar to them than lower resource ones. \\nModel developers will sometimes try to fill in these gaps with machine-translated text, \\nbut translation errors may further compound language misrepresentation. And when \\nmultilingual language models do fail, their unintuitive connections between languages \\ncan make those problems harder to identify, diagnose, and fix.\\nLarge language models’ general use in content analysis raises further concerns. \\nComputational linguists argue that large language models are limited in their capacity \\nto analyze forms of expression not included in their training data, meaning they may \\nstruggle to perform in new contexts. They may also reproduce any biases present in \\ntheir training data. Often, this text is scraped from the internet, meaning that large \\nlanguage models may encode and reinforce dominant views expressed online.\\nLarge Language Models in Non-English Content Analysis\\n7\\n\\u200bCompanies, researchers, and governments each have a role to play in protecting the \\npublic from the potential dangers of multilingual language model content analysis \\nsystems. To ensure better public accountability, companies that deploy large language \\nmodels should always be transparent about how they use them and in which languages. \\nCompanies should deploy language models with narrow remits and adequate channels \\nfor human review.\\nResearchers and research funders meanwhile should invest in efforts to improve the \\nuse and performance of language models in languages other than English, in particular, \\nto reduce failures that disparately impact speakers of lower-resourced languages. The \\nbest way to do this is by supporting language-specific research communities, who can \\npromote the virtuous cycle of collecting data, curating datasets, training language \\nmodels, publishing, and building applications. Local language speakers and context \\nexperts need to be part of each step of this process and also be curating the data and \\nassessing the language models deployed by large, global online services.\\nFinally, governments need to be careful about how they use or encourage the use of \\nlarge language models. Large language models should never power systems used to make \\nhigh-stakes decisions without oversight, such as decisions about immigration status or \\nhealthcare, nor should governments mandate or inadvertently require by law the use of \\nlarge language model-powered systems to moderate content from online services. Instead, \\ngovernments should convene different stakeholders to align on what norms and guardrails \\nshould be around developing and deploying large language models.\\nLarge language models in general and multilingual language models in particular \\nhave the potential to create new economic opportunities and improve the web for \\nall. However, mis- or over-application of these technologies poses real threats to \\nindividuals’ rights, such as undermining their right to free expression by inaccurately \\ntaking down a person’s post on social media or their right to be free of discrimination \\nby misinterpreting an individual’s job or visa application. Multilingual language \\nmodels specifically can inadvertently further entrench the Anglocentrism they are \\nintended to address. In light of these limitations, technology companies, researchers, \\nand governments must consider potential human and civil rights risks when studying, \\nprocuring, developing, or using multilingual language models to power systems, in \\nparticular when they are used to make critical information available or play a role \\nin decisions affecting people’s access to economic opportunities, liberty, or other \\nimportant interests or rights.\\nExecutive Summary\\nLost in Translation\\nCDT Research\\n8\\nIntroduction\\nD\\nespite the modern internet’s power to mobilize and connect \\npeople around the world, the web still does not reflect the \\nlinguistic diversity of its users. In particular, the automated \\nsystems that increasingly mediate our interactions online — \\nsuch as chatbots, search engines, and content moderation systems — \\nare built using and perform far better on English-language text than \\nthe world’s other 7,000 languages (Kornai, 2013; Sengupta, 2022). \\nIndividuals speaking languages other than English face barriers to \\nexpressing themselves freely online and may face greater challenges \\nwhen it comes to accessing critical information, public services, and \\neven asylum and safety (Torbati, 2019).\\nIn the last few years, however, there have been rapid advancements in \\ndeveloping machine learning tools that can analyze content in a wide \\nvariety of languages and across different domains. Large language \\nmodels, machine learning tools trained on enormous amounts of text \\nto recognize patterns in language, power many of these systems. Large \\nlanguage models already underlie translation apps, search autocomplete, \\nand chatbots such as ChatGPT. They are known for being adaptable to \\nmany different language tasks, and today, researchers and technologists \\nare constantly on the lookout for new applications and contexts \\nin which to deploy them. Since the late 2010s, major U.S.-based \\ntechnology companies have mostly invested in building large language \\nmodels that work primarily for English, such as Open AI’s GPT-4, \\nMeta’s LLaMa, and Google’s PaLM.\\nRecently, companies and researchers have begun building and researching \\nmultilingual language models, large language models trained on text \\ndata from several different languages at once. Meta’s XLM-RoBERTa \\n(XLM-R) for instance is trained on text from 100 languages (Meta AI, \\n2019) at once. Google’s mBERT, a multilingual version of its popular \\nBERT model, is trained on 104 languages. Researchers claim that these \\nmodels extend the multifaceted capabilities of large language models to \\nlanguages other than English, even to languages for which there is little or \\nno text data for the model to learn from (Artetxe & Schwenk, 2019; Wu \\n& Dredze, 2019).\\nTechnology companies have their own interests in improving how \\nwell large language models work in different languages. Some may \\nwant to make their products available in multiple languages to gain a \\ncompetitive edge in emerging and populous markets. Online services \\nLarge Language Models in Non-English Content Analysis\\n9\\nthat host user-generated content may especially be interested in using multilingual \\nlanguage models to detect and take action on hate speech, disinformation, and other \\ncontent that violates their policies or the law (Dulhanty et al., 2019). This is top of \\nmind for services after facing criticism for not taking more aggressive action against \\ncontent that incited violence and genocide in Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Myanmar, among \\nothers. Services have begun to deploy multilingual language models into their content \\nmoderation systems: Meta claims their XLM-R model can detect harmful content \\nin all 100 languages it is trained on (Meta AI, 2021); Alphabet’s Perspective API uses \\na large language model to detect toxic content in eighteen different languages (Lees \\net al., 2022); Bumble uses one to detect rude and abusive messages in at least fifteen \\nlanguages (Belloni, 2021). Technology companies are also repurposing these models to \\nmake health care information available and soon may reach into other domains as well \\n(Lunden, 2023).\\nIn the future, governments could also seek to use automated systems built using \\nlarge language models to make information available, answer questions in languages \\nspoken by their constituents (in the form of chatbots), or, more dangerously, analyze \\ninformation to make critical decisions such as benefits allocation or refugee status \\ndeterminations (Kinchin & Mougouei, 2022).\\nStill, studies show that even multilingual language models struggle to deal with the \\nwide disparities between different languages in how much text data they have available \\nto train and test language models. English has, by multiple orders of magnitude, more \\ntext data available than any other language and commands most of the attention of the \\nnatural language processing research community. The abundance of English language \\ndata stems from its position as the official or de facto language of international business, \\npolitics, and media, itself a legacy of British colonialism and American neocolonialism \\nand the subsequent erasure of regional and indigenous languages. American technology \\ncompanies have further entrenched English as the predominant language of the internet \\nby rolling out early standards, coding languages, and social media platforms in English \\nlong before other languages.\\nThe hegemony of English data means that most large language models, even \\nmultilingual ones, are built predominantly using Standard English language text and \\nwork best in Standard English language contexts. Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, and a few \\nother “high resource” languages also have significant amounts of text data available, but \\nmany “medium resource” languages, such as Hindi and Portuguese, and “low resource” \\nlanguages, such as Haitian Creole and Swahili, have hardly any data available at all, and \\nmultilingual language models perform much worse in those languages. This skewed \\nemphasis fails to reflect the diversity of languages spoken by the world’s internet users \\nand further perpetuates the dominance of the English language.\\nIntroduction\\nLost in Translation\\nCDT Research\\n10\\nDespite being deployed in real-world systems, multilingual language models have largely \\nbeen absent from public discourse, particularly about digital rights and public policy, \\nand have instead been relegated to computer science academia and tech company public \\nrelations. This paper seeks to address this gap by offering several resources to bolster \\npolicy discussions. Part I provides a simple technical explanation of how large language \\nmodels work in general, why there is a gap in available data between English and other \\nlanguages, and how multilingual language models attempt to bridge that gap. Part II \\naccounts for the challenges of doing content analysis with large language models in \\ngeneral and multilingual language models in particular, namely:\\n1.\\t Multilingual language models often rely on machine-translated text that can \\ncontain errors or terms native language speakers don’t actually use. \\n2.\\t When multilingual language models fail, their problems are hard to identify, \\ndiagnose, and fix.\\n3.\\t Multilingual language models do not and cannot work equally well in all languages.\\n4.\\t Multilingual language models fail to account for the contexts of local language \\nspeakers.\\nFinally, Part III provides recommendations for companies, researchers, and \\npolicymakers to keep in mind when considering studying, developing, and deploying \\nlarge and multilingual language models to do content analysis. These recommendations \\noffer guidance concerning when large language models should or should not be \\ndeployed, how to improve their performance in non-English languages, and how to \\nensure better accountability and transparency to local language stakeholders.\\nBefore proceeding, two notes on the terminology used in this primer. First, this paper \\nfocuses specifically on one category of applications for large language models: content \\nanalysis, or, the inference and extraction of information, themes, and concepts from \\ntext. The Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT) has written many times about \\nthe limitations of automated content analysis systems (Duarte et al., 2017; Shenkman \\net al., 2021) and the civil liberty risks they can pose, particularly in areas such as content \\nmoderation, student activity monitoring, hiring and more (Grant-Chapman et al., \\n2021; Nicholas, 2022; Vallee & Duarte, 2019). Large language models are already deeply \\nintegrated into many of these technical systems, particularly content moderation, and will \\nsoon become part of many more. Public discourse about large language models has so far \\ndisproportionately focused on text generation, an important area but not the only one. \\nMany of the shortcomings of large language models presented in this report also apply \\nto text generation. As such, this report can be read as a primer on some of the limits of \\ngenerative AI systems as well. However, we choose to focus on content analysis for this \\nreport because of the potential dangers associated with using these models to host and \\nmake information available and the impacts on free expression rights.\\nLarge Language Models in Non-English Content Analysis\\n11\\nSecond, this paper focuses on how multilingual language models perform in languages \\nother than English. We use the shorthand of “non-English languages” for easy reading \\nand because it is the terminology used in the machine learning and policy literature. \\nWe recognize the irony that this term centers the English language and misleadingly \\nimplies all other languages are a monolith. Where possible, we elaborate upon the types \\nof languages we are writing about and make distinct references to specific languages and \\ncultural contexts that will elude models trained primarily in English. In some instances, \\nwe think the term “non-English” captures the sheer Anglocentrism of many of these \\nmodels well by articulating the limited scope in which they are trained and tested.\\nIntroduction\\nLost in Translation\\nCDT Research\\n12\\nI. Background\\nA. How Large Language Models Work\\nNatural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence \\nand linguistics concerned with building computer systems that can \\nprocess and analyze language. NLP underlies many technologies we \\nencounter every day — spellcheck, voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, \\nresume scanners, language translators, and automated hate speech \\ndetection tools, to name a few. Until only a few years ago, when \\ntechnologists wanted to teach a computer to perform a given NLP task, \\nthey would build a system specifically tailored to that task. To create a \\nspam detection system for instance, a technologist might gather many \\nemails, mark which ones are and are not spam, use some of those emails to \\ntrain an algorithm and use others to test how well that algorithm works.\\nToday though, the field has fundamentally reoriented itself around \\nrepurposing large language models to solve nearly every problem. \\nA language model is a mathematical function trained to solve a text \\nprediction task like the following, “Given a sequence of words, predict \\nwhat word will likely come next.” For example, a language model might be \\ngiven the phrase “I was a bad student, I used to skip ____,” and generate \\nas an output that there is a high percent chance the missing word is \\n“class,” a low percent it is “rope,” and a near zero percent it is “clamoring.”\\nThe distribution of language that the model learns in the process can \\neasily be repurposed to many different language tasks. The most often \\ndiscussed application is text generation: conversational agents like \\nChatGPT can repurpose this text prediction task to answer questions, \\nsummarize text, and generate overall “human”-sounding speech. \\nHowever, chatbots are just one application of large language models. \\nOnce a large language model is built, it can be further trained on a \\nsmaller dataset to improve its performance in a specific task, a process \\ncalled fine-tuning. Today, for example, a developer building a spam \\ndetection system might take a general large language model already \\nbuilt by someone else — say Google’s BERT — and fine-tune it to the \\nspecific task of spam detection using a handful of emails already labeled \\nspam or not spam. By building it on top of a language model, the spam \\ndetection system will do a better job of detecting spam that doesn’t \\nperfectly match the language available in the email dataset.\\nLanguage models are not new. Computational linguists have used \\nstatistical models to try to infer rules about language since the 1980s \\n(Nadkarni et al., 2011) and have used “neural networks” (an algorithm \\nloosely modeled on how neurons connect in the brain) to do so since \\nthe early 2010s (Mikolov et al., 2013). What is new though is their \\nLarge Language Models in Non-English Content Analysis\\n13\\nlargeness. Early language models could not be trained on as much data, since they had \\nto read text in sequence, a process that could not be sped up by using more computing \\npower. These early language models struggled to analyze words within the broader \\ncontext of a sentence or document: for instance, one fine-tuned to detect suicidal \\nideation might have difficulty distinguishing between expressions of self-harm (“I \\njust wish I was dead”) and humor (“omg I’m dead”). But in 2017, Google researchers \\nreleased a paper on a new architecture called transformers, which allowed language \\nmodels to train on lots of data at the same time, in parallel rather than in sequence \\n(Vaswani et al., 2017). These transformer-based language models could ingest so much \\ndata simultaneously that they could learn associations between entire sequences of \\nwords, not just individual words. Instead of being shown just {“dead”}, the model \\nwould see a word in its entire context, {“dead”, [“omg”, “I’m”, “_____”]}, thus creating \\na much richer representation of language. Today, the only limit on the size of a language \\nmodel — how much data it ingests and how many connections it makes between \\ndifferent sequences of words (i.e. parameters) — is how much data one can find and \\nhow much developers are willing to spend on processing power.\\nThe output a language model produces is called a representation space, a map of the \\nsequences of words that commonly appear near one another in the training text. For \\nexample, the phrases “It’s so cold outside!” and “I better wear a jacket” may be near one \\nanother in a language model’s representation space, since those sentences often appear \\nclose to one another in writing. This kind of proximity can lead to language models \\ninferring patterns within language that can then help them conduct tasks that it is not \\nexplicitly trained in. In this case, sentences about cold weather being mapped near each \\nother mean the large language model could be trained to detect whether a given phrase \\nis about temperature.\\nWith enough data, a large language model may have such a rich and multifaceted \\nrepresentation of a language that it can learn to do new tasks with only a few, or even \\nzero examples to fine-tune on. For instance, the spam detection system described earlier \\ncould be built with little to no spam to fine-tune on. This capability is called “few-shot” \\nor “zero-shot learning” and is one of the greatest promises of large language models, so \\nmuch so that the original GPT-3 white paper is entitled “Language Models are Few-\\nShot Learners” (Brown et al., 2020).\\nImportantly though, large language models only learn the distribution of language, not \\nits meaning (Bender & Koller, 2020). In the previous “cold” example, the model has not \\nlearned that when one is cold, one puts on a jacket or anything about the deeper meanings \\nof “cold” and “jacket,” only that the words often appear near one another. If one of the \\ndocuments a large language model trains on is a humorous blogpost about the best shorts \\nto wear in cold temperatures, the model could just as easily learn that “shorts” and “cold” \\nare related. Similarly, if a model is trained only on very formal language data, it may never \\nlearn that “nippy” or “brick” (New York City slang) can refer to cold as well.\\nI. Background\\nLost in Translation\\n14\\nTechnologists often try to address these shortcomings by training language models \\non more and more data. If a model is exposed to more data, the idea is that it will be \\nfamiliar with more contexts, and outliers like the ironic cold-weather shorts blogpost \\nwill be outweighed by more representative data. This has led to ballooning in the size \\nof large language models. BERT, a popular open-source model built by Google in \\n2018, was trained on 800 million words from free books and 2.5 billion words from \\nEnglish Wikipedia (Devlin et al., 2019). Two years later, OpenAI released its closed \\nsource GPT-3, which was trained on half a trillion mostly-English words crawled from \\nthe internet (Brown et al., 2020). Google’s PaLM, released in 2022, trained on 780 \\nbillion words, mostly from English-language websites and social media conversations \\n(Chowdhery et al., 2022). As models have grown in size, so have the computation costs \\nof training them. While BERT costs a few thousand dollars in computing power to \\ntrain from scratch and is often trained by academics to build new topic- or language-\\nspecific models (Izsak et al., 2021), GPT-3 and PaLM-sized models cost millions or \\ntens of millions of dollars to train (Sharir et al., 2020). Future models will only be \\nmore expensive, leaving only the most well-off companies able to afford to build them \\n(Bommasani et al., 2021).\\nFigure 1. Language model \\nrepresentation space.

Thus, many technologists simply \\nuse pretrained large language models built by others (usually large companies, with the \\nexpertise and resources) instead of paying to create their own. The few big pretrained \\nmodels that exist have thus become a sort of infrastructure, known as “foundation \\nmodels” (Bommasani et al., 2021). This gives many technologists access to the state of \\nthe art capabilities, but it also creates a single point of failure for the sector as a whole: \\nif a foundation model has a problem, it will persist across many applications. And these \\nmodels are so large and complicated that even when they are open source, researchers \\ncannot understand the underlying logic they use to come up with individual decisions.\\nMany of the largest and most advanced of these foundation models — such as \\nOpenAI’s GPT-4, Google’s PaLM, and Meta’s LLaMa — are trained primarily on \\nEnglish language data. In the next section, we explore one reason why that may be: the \\nresourcedness gap.\\nB. The Resourcedness Gap: Why the Largest \\nLanguage Models are in English\\nEnglish is the closest thing there is to a global lingua franca. It is the dominant language \\nin science, popular culture, higher education, international politics, and global \\ncapitalism; it has the most total speakers and the third-most first-language speakers \\n(Ethnologue, 2023b). It is the primary language spoken on the internet, accounting \\nfor 63.7% of websites, despite being spoken by only 16% of the world’s population \\n(Richter, n.d.). This dominance does not stem from any sort of inherent linguistic \\nsuperiority: rather it is the colonial and neocolonial legacy of nearly three hundred \\nyears of the preeminent global superpower speaking English — first Great Britain, \\nthen the United States. The British government prioritized the English language \\nthrough official language policies to facilitate trade and in an attempt to “modernize” \\nits colonies, and as British, and later American trade became globally dominant, so too \\ndid English (Corradi, 2017; Phillipson, 1992). Prioritization of the English language \\ncame at the expense of other regional and indigenous languages and accelerated \\nlanguage endangerment and economic marginalization, which still impedes digital \\ninvestment into these languages worldwide (Rowe, 2022; S. Zhang et al., 2022). \\nAmerican companies continue to perpetuate the dominance of the English language in \\na new more insidious form, by making online services available to global users without \\ncomparable investment into the languages they speak (Amrute et al., 2022; Kupfer & \\nMuyumba, 2022).\\nI. Background\\nLost in Translation\\nCDT Research\\n16\\nAs a result of these forces, English also dominates the field of natural language \\nprocessing, and there is vastly more raw text data available in English than in any other \\nlanguage by orders of magnitude (Joshi et al., 2020).\\xa0English has the most digitized \\nbooks and patents, the largest Wikipedia, and the biggest internet presence. English is \\nalso by far the language paid the most attention by the global NLP research community. \\nIt is so hegemonic within the field that NLP papers about the English language \\ntypically do not even mention the language in the title or abstract (Bender, 2019). As \\nFigure 2 shows, even among NLP papers that do mention a language in the abstract, \\nEnglish is mentioned over ten times as often as the next most mentioned language, \\nGerman (ACL Rolling Review Dashboard, 2022).\\nThis wealth of data and research makes it significantly easier to build large language \\nmodels in English than in any other language. More raw text data, also known as \\nunlabeled data, means more data for the model to be trained on; more research means \\nthat there are more datasets annotated with information, also known as labeled data, \\nthat can be used to test how well models complete different types of language tasks. \\nThis creates a virtuous cycle for English-language NLP —\\xa0more labeled and unlabeled \\ndata leads to more research attention, which leads to increased demand for labeled and \\nunlabeled data, and so on.\\nEnglish is the prime example of a high resource language, a language for which a lot of \\nhigh-quality data resources exist. Though it has the most data available of any language \\n(English could be called an “extremely” high resource language), there are six other \\nlanguages that could be considered high resource — the official UN languages list, \\nminus Russian, plus Japanese (see Table 1). There are also a few dozen medium resource \\nlanguages, such as Urdu, Italian, and Tagalog, with another one or two orders of \\nmagnitude less data, or about one hundredth or one-thousandth of available English data. \\nThe rest of the world’s 6,000 plus languages can be considered low resource or extremely \\nlow resource, with only small amounts of written text available (Joshi et al., 2020).\\nResourcedness can vary within languages as well. Languages such as Arabic and Spanish \\ndiffer so much between dialects that many are mutually incomprehensible, even if \\nthey mostly use the same written form. Languages can also have different sociolects, \\nvarying across different social groups, identity groups, and contexts (e.g. formal versus \\ninformal). Regional dialects and sociolects can vary in degrees of difference from \\nhaving different vocabulary and grammatical structures (e.g. Australian English or \\nAfrican American English versus Standard American English) to make extensive use of \\nborrowed words from other languages (e.g. Nigerian English, Indian English), to fully \\nhybrid bilingual dialects (e.g. Spanglish, Hinglish). However, the available digitized \\ntext of language often doesn’t reflect the full spectrum of variation that exists within a \\nlanguage. (Bergman & Diab, 2022). Data scraped from the internet in particular over-\\nindexes Standard English spoken by younger people in developed countries (Luccioni \\n& Viviano, 2021). Other languages have just as much dialectical diversity as English and \\nalso likely over-index on certain dialects.\\nLarge Language Models in Non-English Content Analysis\\n17\\nFigure 2.

Top most mentioned \\nlanguages in abstracts of papers published \\nby the Association for Computational \\nLinguistics, May 2022-January 2023.\\nSource: (Santy et al., 2023)\\nPaper Abstracts\\nLanguages with less data available also often have lower quality data available, either \\nbecause it is mislabeled or otherwise not representative of how people actually speak \\nthe language. This is particularly true with web-crawled data, a key data source for \\nlarge language models (Khan & Hanna, 2023). Non-English language data scraped \\nfrom the internet is more often machine translated, scanned from an image, or both, \\nand each of those processes introduces opportunities for error (Dodge et al., 2021). \\nLow- and medium-resource language data on the internet is more often pornographic, \\nnonsensical, or non-linguistic content (Kreutzer et al., 2022). It is also often labeled as \\nthe incorrect language – around 95% of the time for many low resource languages – \\nbecause automatic language identification works much more poorly with insufficient \\ndata, thus creating a circular problem (Caswell et al., 2020). Languages with the worst \\nquality web data are disproportionately those written in non-Latin scripts (e.g. Urdu, \\nJapanese, Arabic) and those spoken in the Global South (e.g. African languages, \\nminority languages in the Middle East, non-Mandarin Chinese languages) (Kreutzer et \\nal., 2022).\\n17\\n0\\n200\\n300\\n100\\nEnglish\\nKorean\\nIndonesian\\nThai\\nFrench\\nGreek\\nTurkish\\nFinnish\\nGerman\\nSpanish\\nSwahili\\nClassical Chinese\\nHindi\\nHebrew\\nPolish\\nItalian\\nKinyarwanda\\nArabic\\nRussian\\nTalugu\\nDutch\\nJapanese\\nVietnamese\\nPortuguese\\nLatin\\nMarathi\\n311\\n27\\n18\\n16\\n16\\n16\\n16\\n13\\n10\\n7\\n7\\n7\\n6\\n5\\n5\\n5\\n4\\n4\\n4\\n4\\n4\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n3\\nI. Background\\nLost in Translation\\nCDT Research\\n18\\nLow resource languages also tend to have data that comes from a less diverse set of \\nsources. The clean data that does exist often comes from places such as Wikipedia, the \\nBible, and parliamentary proceedings, particularly in large language models that depend \\non drawing parallels between low and high resource languages (see III.B and III.C) \\n(Nekoto et al., 2020). None of these data sources is representative of a language as a \\nwhole. For example, there is a significant gender gap when it comes to who contributes \\nto Wikipedia, with studies finding that the percentage of women who edit Wikipedia \\narticles remains “dismally low” (Callahan & Herring, 2011; Vitulli, 2018), and it \\ndoesn’t reflect a more casual style of speech. Some text on Wikipedia is also machine-\\ntranslated — Cebuano, Swedish, and Waray for instance are some of the Wikipedia \\nlanguages with the most articles, but most are translated by the same bot (Lokhov, \\n2021). The Bible is similarly its own unique domain, unrepresentative of language at \\nlarge, but is overrepresented in the training data for non-English large language models. \\nThis can lead to errors in the tone and substance of language. For example, for a period \\nof time, running a word repeated enough times through Google translate produced a \\nreligious-sounding text: the word “dog” pasted two dozen times and translated from \\nMaori to English produced text about Jesus’ return at the end of days (Christian, 2018).\\nThe resourcedness of a language is often out of sync with the number of speakers or \\ninternet users that language has. Hindi, Bengali, and Indonesian are medium-resource \\nlanguages yet each has hundreds of millions of speakers (Joshi et al., 2020). Guaraní, \\nan Indigenous language spoken by most of the ~7 million-person population of \\nParaguay, hardly has any data resources at all (Góngora et al., 2021). Fula, a language \\nspoken by tens of millions of West Africans, also has few data sets (Nguer et al., 2020). \\nDespite over 600 million internet users across the African continent, nearly all African \\nlanguages remain low-resourced.\\nTable 1.

Individual NLP communities have formed around many languages in \\norder to kickstart and perpetuate the virtuous cycle of research attention and benchmark \\ndevelopment, including collectives such as IndoNLP for languages spoken in Indonesia \\nand Masakhane for African languages (Cahyawijaya et al., 2022; Nekoto et al., 2020; Orife \\net al., 2020), and conferences such as the Association for Computational Linguistics’ \\nlow resource language track, and AmericasNLP for indigenous languages (ACL, 2021; \\nAmericasNLP, 2022; Masakhane, n.d.). Tech companies have also sought to expand the \\nnumber of language models their models work in, in part by creating more data sets, \\nincluding with projects like Facebook’s No Language Left Behind project and Google’s \\n1000 Languages Initiative (NLLB Team et al., 2022; Vincent, 2022). DARPA even \\nfunded the Low Resource Languages for Emergent Incidents (LORELEI) program in \\n2014 to improve translation about emergency incidents into low resource languages \\n(Corvey, 2014). But the gaps between English, other high resource languages, and low \\nresource languages remain large and are growing exponentially greater by the day, at least \\nin terms of available, raw digitized data.\\nThe response by the NLP community has not just been to collect more language \\ndata but also to employ technical tricks to help language models squeeze the most \\nperformance out of the little data they have. In the next section, we discuss the primary \\ntechnical architecture developers use to do this: multilingual language models.\\nC. Multilingual Language Models: Efforts to \\nBridge the Resourcedness Gap\\nIn English, most large language models are monolingual, meaning that they train mostly \\non data from one language. Researchers have also built monolingual models in non-\\nEnglish languages: for instance, the architecture for Google’s BERT model — one of \\nthe most popular and cheapest to train — has been utilized for French (CamemBERT), \\nItalian (AlBERTo), Arabic (AraBERT), Dutch (BERTje), Basque (BERTeus), Maltese \\n(BERTu), and Swahili (SwahBERT), to name a few (Agerri et al., 2020; Antoun et al., \\n2020; de Vries et al., 2019; G. Martin et al., 2022; L. Martin et al., 2020; Micallef et al., \\n2022; Polignano et al., 2019). However, in general, these monolingual models perform \\nworse in their respective languages than the best English models do in English because \\nthey don’t have as much data to train on.\\nThis lack of data manifests in different ways depending on the specific task a model is \\nfine-tuned to perform. Some language model capabilities — usually ones that depend \\non fact retrieval — improve linearly with size. For instance, the more data a language \\nmodel is exposed to, the better it is at answering trivia questions or reformatting \\ndata (Srivastava et al., 2022). Other capabilities — usually ones with multiple steps \\nI. Background\\nLost in Translation\\nCDT Research\\n20\\nor components — exhibit a “breakthrough” behavior, where once a model reaches a \\ncertain size, it improves sharply at the task. For instance, language models typically are \\nunable to write code or add three digit numbers until they train on a certain amount \\nof data, at which point their performance improves dramatically (Ganguli et al., 2022). \\nLow and extremely low resource languages often do not have enough data to train a \\nlarge language model at all, but medium and even high resource languages may not \\nhave the hundreds of millions, or billions of words of text data necessary to achieve the \\nbreakthroughs that English can (Y. Zhang et al., 2021).\\nBesides technical limitations, companies may not be interested in deploying a different \\nmonolingual model for every language their product is available in for business reasons \\nas well. Maintaining and debugging one large language model for each language \\nintroduces costs that scale per language introduced, introducing complexity and \\nadditional overhead costs. Companies that seek to expand into new global markets \\nwill likely try to keep their costs fixed by reusing as much infrastructure as possible, \\nincluding language models.\\nTherefore, instead of using monolingual models to do NLP tasks in non-English \\nlanguages, researchers and developers most often use multilingual language models, \\nsuch as Google’s mBERT and Meta’s XLM-R, which are trained on texts from \\nmany different languages at once. Like their monolingual counterparts, multilingual \\nlanguage models are trained on a fill-in-the-blank task. However, by training on text \\nfrom several different languages, multilingual language models can, at least in theory, \\ninfer connections between languages, acting as a sort of bridge between high and low \\nresource languages, allowing the former to bootstrap the latter.\\nFor instance, imagine that an Indian climate change researcher wants to use a language \\nmodel to collect all Hindi-language tweets about the weather. A monolingual language \\nmodel trained on just Hindi text may not have enough data to have seen the words \\n“thaand” (“cold” in Hindi) and “shaal” or (“shawl” in Hindi) appear near one another \\nin text, so it may miss that tweets to the effect of “Main Agast mein shaal pahanta \\nhoon” (“I put a shawl on in August”) is a sentence about cold weather.1 A multilingual \\nmodel, trained on data from English, Hindi, and many other languages may have seen \\ntext where “thaand” appears near “cold,” “shaal” appears near “shawl,” and “cold” \\nappears near “shawl,” thereby allowing the model to infer that “thaand” and “shaal” are \\ninterrelated terms.\\nMultilingual language models are usually not trained on equal volumes of data from \\neach language: mBERT for instance is trained on 15.5 GB of English text but as little \\nas 10 MB of Yoruba text (Wu & Dredze, 2020). Even BLOOM, a popular multilingual \\nmodel by BigScience with a particular focus on language representation, has 30% of its \\n1\\t  Transliterated into Roman script for ease of reading for an English-language reader.\\nLarge Language Models in Non-English Content Analysis\\n21\\nFigure 3. Monolingual vs multilingual \\nlanguage model representation \\nspace. A visualization of a monolingual \\nand a multilingual langauge model’s \\nrepresentation space, collapsed into three \\ndimensions.\\nSource: (Schwenk, 2019) \\ntraining text in English (BigScience Workshop et al., 2023). In large part, this is because \\nof the lack of available data in these languages, which come disproportionately from \\nWikipedia and religious texts, as discussed earlier (see Part I.C).\\nJust as a monolingual language model can be fine-tuned to work better on an individual \\ntask, a multilingual language model can be fine-tuned to work better in an individual \\nlanguage. Imagine for instance a developer who wants to use a multilingual language \\nmodel to detect Indonesian election disinformation on social media. One way they \\ncould do it is by using an out-of-the-box multilingual model, such as BLOOM, and \\nfine-tuning it by showing examples of false narratives circulated in Indonesian related \\nto the local election. This likely would not work very well though, since BLOOM has \\nonly been exposed to a limited amount of data on Indonesian text —\\xa0only 1.2% of its \\ntraining data is in Indonesian (BigScience Workshop et al., 2023). Another better way \\nto do it, if the developer has access to more Indonesian language data, would be first to \\nfine-tune the model on additional Indonesian text (essentially, continuing to learn the \\nfill-in-the-missing-word task, but this time just in Indonesian) and then further fine-\\ntuning it on the task election disinfo detection using that dataset.\\nModel developers though do not always have enough text data to sufficiently fine-\\ntune a multilingual model to work in a specific language. To make up for this, they \\noften use imperfect machine-translated text. The two main methods of incorporating \\ntranslated text are called translate-train or translate-test methods. With translate-train, \\na multilingual language model is fine-tuned on data that has been translated from \\n(usually) English into a desired lower resource language (Conneau & Lample, 2019). \\nWith translate-test, a (usually) English monolingual language model is fine-tuned \\non data translated from the desired language into English, and all testing data gets \\ntranslated into English as well (Artetxe, Labaka, et al., 2020).\\nI.

With the \\ntranslate-train approach, a developer would take a large volume of English text data, \\nmachine translate it into Basque, use that data to fine-tune a pretrained multilingual \\nlanguage model, and then further fine-tune it to the task of terrorist content detection \\nusing the native Basque data. With translate-test, a developer would fine-tune a \\npretrained English language model on data translated from Basque to English, and \\nthen further fine-tune it by translating the terrorist content data they have into English. \\nSubsequently, to analyze Basque text, it would first have to be translated into English \\nbefore being evaluated by the model. Reliance on translated data raises many concerns, \\nas discussed in Part II.C.1.\\nHowever, translated texts can help multilingual language models learn connections \\nbetween languages. By feeding a model parallel texts — for instance, explicitly \\ninforming it that “baahar bohut thand hai” and “It’s so cold outside” have the same \\nmeaning — it can better extrapolate other language parallels as well (e.g. NLLB Team et \\nal., 2022; Reid & Artetxe, 2022). Multilingual language models can learn connections \\nbetween languages without explicit labeling, instead inferring relationships between \\nlanguages on its own through borrowed words, numbers, and URLs (Pires et al., 2019). \\nIn general, NLP researchers understand little about why it is that multilingual language \\nmodels can be effectively fine-tuned to work in languages that they have relatively little \\ndata for (Conneau, Khandelwal, et al., 2020; Pires et al., 2019; Wu & Dredze, 2019). \\nSome argue that it is because multilingual language models have inferred language-\\nagnostic concepts and universal rules that can be applied to any language (Artetxe, Ruder, \\net al., 2020; Chi et al., 2020; Conneau, Wu, et al., 2020; Tsvetkov et al., 2016). Others \\nsay that multilingual language models are just effective imitators (Bender et al., 2021; \\nLauscher et al., 2020). The debate is impossible to fully resolve because of the overall \\ncomplexity and opacity of large language models, but so far evidence suggests that at \\nbest, the linguistic universals they learn are limited to narrow semantic and syntactic \\ndomains (Libovický et al., 2019; Wu & Dredze, 2019), such as learning plural/singular \\nverb agreement across multiple languages (de Varda & Marelli, 2023). But even if a model \\ncan infer syntactic or semantic commonalities between languages, such inferences will \\nnot necessarily help it manage more complex, context-dependent tasks (Choi et al., 2021). \\nFor instance, in some languages, multilingual language models do no better than random \\nguessing at detecting hate speech (Lin et al., 2022). As will be discussed in the next section, \\nthese are hardly the only limits of multilingual language models.\\n23\\nLost in Translation\\nII. Limitations of \\nLanguage Models \\nin English and Non-\\nEnglish Contexts T\\nhe press, technology companies, and social media are abuzz \\nabout the potential of large language models. In this section, \\nhowever, we discuss the shortcomings of these models, \\nparticularly as they operate in non-English language contexts. \\nIn the first section, we discuss general concerns with building and \\ndeploying large language models. These concerns apply both to the \\nEnglish and non-English contexts. In the second section, we look at the \\nproblems more specifically raised by multilingual language models.\\nA. Concerns with Building and \\nDeploying Large Language Models\\n1. LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS ARE BOUND BY \\nLANGUAGE THEY HAVE SEEN BEFORE AND STRUGGLE \\nTO PERFORM IN NEW CONTEXTS.\\nA large language model does not understand language; instead, it makes \\nprobabilistic inferences about text based on the distribution of language \\nwithin the data it is trained on. Bender and Koller argue that this means \\nlanguage models are limited to contexts they have encountered before \\nand struggle greatly in those they have not (2020). NLP researchers have \\nalready proven this is the case in generative AI by demonstrating several \\nunintuitive outcomes: for instance, language models are better able to \\nperform mathematical operations with numbers that appear frequently \\nin written language (e.g., multiplying numbers by 24), than numbers \\nthat appear infrequently (e.g. multiplying numbers by 23) (Razeghi \\net al., 2022). Large language models may exhibit similar limitations in \\ncontent analysis as well. For instance, if a large language model were \\nused to analyze a candidate’s resume, it may struggle to account for \\nlesser-known companies or newer skill sets without up-to-date, domain-\\nspecific data to fine-tune on. These tasks are reliant on in-context \\nknowledge and without domain-specific training, i.e. training an off-\\nthe-shelf large language model with text relevant to the task at hand, \\nthese models are likely to perform poorly and their purported domain-\\nagnostic abilities should garner skepticism (Duarte et al., 2017). \\nLost in Translation\\nCDT Research\\n24\\n2. LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS REPRODUCE THE BIASES, VALUES, \\nAND HARMS OF THE DATA THEY TRAIN ON.\\nLarge language models are built using vast quantities of text scraped from the internet \\nand exhibit all the biases and limitations of their data source (Okerlund et al., 2022). \\nSome commonly used datasets, such as Common Crawl, include large volumes of \\nhate speech and sexually explicit content (Luccioni & Viviano, 2021). Other problems \\nare more nefarious. For example, researchers found that when GPT-3 generated \\ncompletions for the prompt “Two Muslims walked into a___,” 66% of completions \\nincluded violent language, three times more than for other religious groups (Abid et \\nal., 2021). Others have found similar entrenched biases against people with disabilities, \\nfor example inferring negative sentiment from sentences that include disability-related \\nterms (Hutchinson et al., 2020).\\nThough technologists often try to pull out explicitly harmful data from training \\nsets, models can still reify harms, such as referring to “women doctors” or calling \\nundocumented immigrants “illegals” (Bender et al., 2021). Removing these instances \\nof harmful data from training datasets, which are disproportionately outsourced \\nto underpaid staff around the world, also imposes labor and psychological burdens \\n(Williams et al., 2022). \\nEven if datasets are rid of specific examples of harmful text, they will nonetheless \\ncontain values and assumptions that are encoded into the language we speak and the \\ndominant perspectives that exist in many pieces of written text, particularly government \\ndocuments or state-run media pieces that may make up the bulk of text available for \\nlow resource languages (Bender et al., 2021). Many machine learning researchers fail to \\nconsider these problems in their work — one study found that 98% of machine learning \\npapers mention no negative potential of the technologies they are describing (Birhane \\net al., 2022). Yet the risks are very real: as Birhane & Prabhu put it, “Feeding AI systems \\non the world’s beauty, ugliness, and cruelty, but expecting it to reflect only the beauty \\nis a fantasy” (2021). When these problems exist in any particularly popular foundation \\nmodel, they proliferate across many different applications built on top of that model.\\n3. THE DATA LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS TRAIN ON RAISE \\nCOPYRIGHT AND PRIVACY CONCERNS.\\nLegal experts also raise concerns about copyright and ownership of text that make up \\nthe vast quantities of data that train and distinguish large models (Ebers et al., 2022; \\nOkerlund et al., 2022). Getty Images has sued the creators of Stable Diffusion, an AI \\ntool that creates images based on written prompts, claiming that the toolscraped Getty’s \\ndatabases of proprietary images and photos without permission (Vincent, 2023a). Legal \\nquestions about ownership of text and whether scraping proprietary text is lawful (e.g., \\nbecause it constitutes fair use) or not remain unanswered (Kublik, n.d.).\\nLarge Language Models in Non-English Content Analysis\\n25\\nII. Limitations of Language Models in English and Non-English Contexts\\nSome datasets that large language models train on are likely to capture examples of \\nlanguage from sites such as social media, raising personal data privacy concerns. There \\nis a high possibility that in gathering exchanges from social media networks, training \\ndatasets inadvertently contain private and even sensitive information, which increases \\nthe risk of models leaking details like names, phone numbers, or addresses from the data \\non which they’re trained (Carlini et al., 2021, 2023).\\n4. TRAINING LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS COULD HAVE A \\nSIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT.\\nFinally, there are increasing concerns about the environmental cost of producing large \\nlanguage models. Scholars and advocates have raised concerns about the environmental \\nimpact of training these models, particularly the largest ones with billions of \\nparameters, due to their intense computation requirements (Crawford, 2021; Okerlund \\net al., 2022). There is preliminary research attempting to quantify the energy impacts \\nof computation at this scale (Kaack et al., 2022), but some early estimates suggest that \\ntraining a single BERT model, one that serves as the foundation for some multilingual \\nlanguage models, requires as much energy as a trans-American flight (Strubell et al., \\n2019). Large language models, like GPT-3, require thousands of times more (Heikkilä, \\n2022). Png writes that these costs may be concentrated in poorer countries, where \\nserver farms and raw materials required to build necessary infrastructure are often \\nlocated (2022).\\nB. Limitations of Multilingual Language Models\\n1. MULTILINGUAL LANGUAGE MODELS OFTEN RELY ON MACHINE-\\nTRANSLATED TEXT THAT CAN CONTAIN ERRORS OR TERMS NATIVE \\nLANGUAGE SPEAKERS DON’T ACTUALLY USE.\\nIncorporating machine-translated data into the training and fine-tuning of multilingual \\nlanguage models creates various opportunities for the model to malfunction. \\nMultilingual language models that depend on translation may struggle to build \\naccurate representations of words or concepts which have different connotations in \\ndifferent languages. For instance, in English, “dove” is a term associated with peace, but \\nits equivalent in Basque, “uso,” is an emasculating insult. A translation-based cross-\\nlingual model that does not train on the word “uso” used in its native context could \\npotentially fail to see it used in a call for violence since the English mapping is so closely \\nassociated with “peace.”\\nLost in Translation\\nCDT Research\\n26\\nAnother issue is what NLP practitioners call the “translationese” problem (Yu et al., \\n2022) — that is, machine-translated language materially differs from how human \\nnative speakers naturally use language (Bizzoni et al., 2020; Teich, 2003). In generative \\nAI, translationese can result in mono- or multilingual language models simplifying \\nor overcomplicating sentences, producing repeated words, using too common or too \\nuncommon words, borrowing too much or too little from the original language, and \\nother patterns of speech native speakers would not use (Volansky et al., 2015). These \\nmistakes are not consistent between languages or systems, so it would be difficult for \\nmodels to be able to systematically root them out, though some argue that it is possible \\n(Yu et al., 2022).\\nThe problems of machine translation spread beyond models that intentionally train on \\nit. The web is filled with machine-translated text, and models that train on web-scraped \\ndata will inadvertently encounter a lot of it, particularly in low resource languages \\n(Kreutzer et al., 2022). For instance, a lot of the Catalan data that exists on the web, \\nparticularly on websites using the .cat top-level domain, is translated using Google \\nTranslate, even on official government websites (Pym et al., 2022). Even benchmarks to \\ntest how well multilingual language models work in high and low resource languages are \\noften translated from another language, leaving researchers with less of a sense of how \\nwell these models work on language as spoken by native speakers. For instance, OpenAI \\ntested GPT-4’s capabilities in 26 languages, but using only benchmarks translated from \\nEnglish (OpenAI, 2023).\\n2. MULTILINGUAL LANGUAGE MODELS FAIL TO ACCOUNT FOR THE \\nCONTEXTS OF LOCAL LANGUAGE SPEAKERS.\\nAs discussed earlier, large language models only work well in contexts similar to \\ncontexts of the data they are trained on. A language model trained on legal texts, \\nfor instance, will perform much better on law-related tasks than medical tasks \\nor interpreting the Quran (Koehn & Knowles, 2017). This poses a problem for \\nmultilingual language models, which, particularly in low resource languages, are trained \\non text that is translated from other language contexts or comes from a few distinctive \\ncontexts, such as Wikipedia and the Bible. Multilingual language models that are not \\ntrained on large volumes of text from native speakers of a given language will more \\noften fail at tasks that require knowledge of an individual speaker’s local context, such \\nas hate speech detection and resume scanning (Lin et al., 2022).\\nImagine, for example, a multilingual language model fine-tuned to detect anti-\\nMuslim content in Assamese, a low-resource language with fifteen million speakers, \\npredominantly in northeast India (Ethnologue, 2023a). Assamese and Bengali are both \\nmedium resource languages, so a multilingual model may draw connections between \\nthe two. However, anti-Muslim hate speech is very closely tied to historical events and \\nthe specific political conditions of Assam. For instance, the term “Bangladeshi Muslim,” \\nLarge Language Models in Non-English Content Analysis\\n27\\nII. Limitations of Language Models in English and Non-English Contexts\\nneutral in many other languages and contexts, is a hate speech dog whistle in Assamese \\nbecause it casts Assamese Muslims as foreigners (a concept that is itself closely tied to the \\nIndian government’s repatriation efforts) (Avaaz, 2019). A multilingual model neither \\ntrained on extensive native Assamese text nor explicitly trained by a language expert would \\nlikely not be able to capture this hyperlocal distinction.\\nMultilingual language models work by transferring between language contexts, but that \\ntransfer often means simply that the context of higher resource languages overwrites \\nlower resource ones. Spanish, for instance, tends to use more adjectives and analogies \\ndescribing extreme situations than English, so a sentiment detection algorithm that \\ntransfers linguistic properties over from English may mischaracterize Spanish text as \\nhaving a stronger emotional valence than it would to a native speaker (Stadthagen-\\nGonzalez et al., 2017). This structure transfer can also bring the biases of a source \\nlanguage into a target language (Savoldi et al., 2021). For instance, if a language without \\ngender pronouns, such as Hungarian or Yoruba, is mapped onto a language with \\ngendered third-person pronouns, such as English or French, the language model could \\nforce gender associations and biases of the gendered language onto the non-gendered \\none, as often occurs in translation (Prates et al., 2020) (see Figure 4).\\nFigure 4. Google Translate from \\nHungarian to English. A screenshot of \\nGoogle Translate, circa 2020, showing how \\nthe multilingual language models project \\ngender onto genderless languages.\\nSource: (Prates et al., 2020)\\n27\\nLost in Translation\\nCDT Research\\n28\\n3. MULTILINGUAL LANGUAGE MODELS DO NOT AND CANNOT WORK \\nEQUALLY WELL IN ALL LANGUAGES.\\nMultilingual language models not only do not work equally well in all languages but \\nthey cannot, since the more languages a multilingual model is trained on, the less it \\ncan capture unique traits of any specific languages. This problem is called the curse \\nof multilinguality (Lauscher et al., 2020). Large language model developers are thus \\nforced to trade off performance between disparate languages; making a model work \\nbetter in Hindi for example, may come at a cost to its performance in English. In \\npractice, when technology companies must choose which languages to deprioritize \\nwithin their multilingual language models, they may be incentivized to have them \\nbe languages where speakers tend to be less wealthy, have less political power, or live \\noutside of the company’s priority markets, thus exacerbating the resourcedness gap they \\nare designed to address.\\nIn general, semantic and syntactic similarity to a high resource language protects \\nfrom the curse of multilinguality (Eronen et al., 2023). For instance, Muller et al. \\ntested mBERT on languages it had not explicitly trained on before and found that it \\nworked better in Swiss German (related to German, a high resource language), than \\nit did in Estonian (a Uralic language, like medium resource languages Hungarian and \\nFinnish), than it does Uyghur (a Turkic language, distant from any high or medium \\nresource language, with four alphabets) (2021). In general, multilingual language \\nmodels struggle with languages written in non-Latin scripts (Pires et al., 2019; Ruder \\net al., 2021), language isolates (languages etymologically distinct from all other \\nlanguages, such as Basque), and families of languages less connected to those of high \\nresource languages. This threatens to create a poor-get-poorer dynamic for languages \\nthat are only similar to other low resource languages, as is the case with many widely \\nspoken African languages including Swahili, Amharic, and Kabyle (Joshi et al., 2020). \\nThis dynamic further strengthens the post-colonial structural inequality discussed \\nthroughout this report.\\nMultilingual language models are also forced to trade off between languages in the \\nvocabulary they use. Large language models train on the problem of predicting the next \\nword in a sentence. If a model is trying to guess the word to fill in “Today I feel ___,” it \\nwill have a harder time doing so if it has to choose between ten million possible words \\nfrom any language instead of just a few hundred thousand English words. The total \\nnumber of words a language model has to choose from is called its vocabulary size. The \\nlarger a model’s vocabulary size, the more different possible words it can generate and \\nrecognize, but also the more computational resources it takes to train. Multilingual \\nlanguage models use all kinds of shortcuts to get their vocabulary size down. For instance, \\nLarge Language Models in Non-English Content Analysis\\n29\\nthey will often transliterate languages into Latin scripts or train the model to guess the \\nnext subword (e.g. breaking “tasks” into “ta” and “##sks”) or letter instead of the full \\nword, thus collapsing the barrier between languages (Tay et al., 2022; C. Wang et al., \\n2020). These shortcuts cut down on costs, but they also reduce a model’s ability to \\ncapture semantic relationships between words, thus degrading its performance overall.\\nVocabulary is often decided by how frequently different words, subwords, and \\nletters appear in a model’s training text, and since multilingual language models are \\ntrained mostly on English data, their vocabularies will skew towards English as well. \\nA multilingual model may have a relatively obscure word like “riposte” in its English \\nvocabulary, but be may missing common words in other high resource languages (e.g., \\n“escritorio” in Spanish), common subwords in medium resource languages, (e.g., “tzv” \\nin Hebrew), and entire letters in low resource languages (e.g., a character that appears in \\nTigrinya but not other Ge’ez-based scripts). This inferior representation makes models \\nperform worse in a variety of tasks, and makes content analysis systems far easier to trick \\nby doing things like changing white space, using typos, or in the case of toxic content \\ndetection, adding common, positive words like “love” (Gröndahl et al., 2018; Lees et al., \\n2022).\\n4. WHEN MULTILINGUAL LANGUAGE MODELS FAIL, THEIR \\nPROBLEMS ARE HARD TO IDENTIFY, DIAGNOSE, AND FIX.\\nNLP practitioners depend on benchmarks to determine both how well a language \\nmodel performs at specific tasks and how close it is in general to achieving “natural \\nlanguage understanding” (Bender & Koller, 2020). This latter type of benchmarking \\nis very difficult in all languages, since it is hard to generalize about a language model’s \\ncapabilities from only a handful of disparate tests (Raji et al., 2021). However, the \\nchallenges of both types of benchmarks are exacerbated in the multilingual context. \\nThe disparities in NLP research attention and labeled data between languages mean \\nthat there are far more benchmarks and tasks that can be used to test models in English \\nthan in other languages, particularly low resource ones. Models developed to operate in \\nnon-English contexts are still usually tested with benchmarks translated from English \\nwhich, as discussed earlier, is often markedly different from the target language.\\nThe alternative to translation is hiring people local to the contexts a model is being \\napplied to and paying them to create data sets and develop benchmarks. This works \\nparticularly well for models built to do a specific task in a specific language (Nguyen, \\n2020; Tattle, n.d.), but is very expensive and resource intensive to scale up for models \\nmeant to work in many languages and contexts. It also raises challenging questions \\nfor detecting bias in language models (Talat et al., 2022) and performing inherently \\nII. Limitations of Language Models in English and Non-English Contexts\\nLost in Translation\\nCDT Research\\n30\\npolitical tasks, such as content moderation. For instance, a social media company trying \\nto create a dataset of inflammatory content posted in Bosnia and Herzegovina needs \\npeople who are experts in multiple ethnic conflicts and languages (Bosnian, Serbian, \\nMontenegrin, and Macedonian) but also unbiased in those conflicts, all in a country \\nthat lacks media pluralism or a strong civil society sector (Article 19, 2022). Scaling this \\nto every geopolitical problem discussed in all languages on a given online service is a \\ndaunting, if not impossible, task.\\nWhen problems with multilingual language models can be found, it is often difficult \\nto determine why they are occurring. Large language models are already opaque, even \\nto those who develop them — neural networks, the core technology underlying large \\nlanguage models, are known for being particularly obtuse and for representing language \\nin a way that doesn’t map cleanly onto human-understandable concepts (Nicholas, \\n2020). However, multilingual language models are particularly opaque because they \\nmake unintuitive, hard-to-trace connections between languages. Take for instance, \\nthis case from an NLP paper: the Google researchers behind the Perspective API, a \\nmodel for detecting “toxic” content, found that their model flagged tweets that used \\nthe Italian word “sfiga” (which roughly translates to “bad luck”) as hate speech because \\ntwo of the three examples included in the training dataset that contained the subword \\n“sfiga” were labeled as hate speech (“sfigati” is an insult meaning “loser”) (Lees et \\nal., 2020). If this were a multilingual model that had mapped Italian learnings onto \\nTurkish analysis, perhaps sentences with the equivalent Turkish word for “unlucky” \\n(“şanssız”) would also be flagged as hate speech. Even if researchers had access to all the \\ndata used to train that multilingual model, it would be extremely difficult to locate and \\nfix this bug without knowing Italian or understanding how the model had mapped \\nthese relationships.\\n31\\nLost in Translation\\nIII. Recommendations E\\nfforts to improve language models’ performance in various \\nlanguages and contexts are exciting, as they may boost \\nconnectivity and information exchange for billions of users \\naround the world. However, language models are limited in their \\ncapabilities, and employing them too widely, without safeguards, or for \\nthe wrong kinds of tasks has the potential to raise civil liberties concerns \\nand erect new barriers (Maundu, 2023). Unthinking deployment \\nof large language models may impede peoples’ ability to access \\ninformation, employment, and public benefits, with disparate impacts \\nfor individuals in the Global South where many of the low resource \\nlanguages are spoken. We should be cautious about the rapid adoption \\nof these technologies, especially as building blocks for other types of \\nautomation in high-stakes arenas like content moderation, employment \\nsoftware, and resource allocation.\\nIn this section, we offer recommendations for companies, researchers, and \\ngovernments to take into consideration as they build, study, and regulate \\nlarge language models, particularly in non-English language contexts.\\nA. Companies\\nTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES SHOULD DISCLOSE WHEN, \\nHOW, AND IN WHAT LANGUAGES THEY USE LARGE \\nLANGUAGE MODELS.\\nTo better understand the problems and challenges with deploying large \\nlanguage models in different languages, researchers and the public need \\nto know where to look. Companies that incorporate language models \\ninto their technical systems should always disclose how they are using \\nthem, which languages they are using them in, and what languages they \\nhave been trained on. Currently, the approach of many companies to AI \\ntransparency consists of trumpeting the capabilities of their AI systems \\nin blog posts and press releases, and, for a few larger firms, releasing \\nresearch versions of their language models that still differ from the ones \\nthey use in production. Despite publishing on AI and pushing the field \\nforward, technology companies tend to hold information about their \\nproduction AI systems, even basic information about what languages \\nthey are used in, close to the chest.\\nLost in Translation\\nCDT Research\\n32\\nAcademics and civil society have written extensively about how technology companies, \\nparticularly online service providers, could offer better transparency and accountability \\nfor their AI systems, including language models. The Santa Clara Principles, a set of \\nprinciples developed and revised by global civil society groups, provides examples of \\nthe types of disclosures companies can make about their content moderation policies \\nand processes (2021). Groups like BigScience also pave the way, exemplifying the type \\nof documentation other model-developers can publish about their content analysis \\nsystems, including model cards, transparency reports, and other avenues to disclose \\nmore information about the linguistic makeup of a model’s training data (e.g. what \\nlanguages it has trained on, how much data from each language, where those datasets \\ncome from). Better transparency creates opportunities for external actors to more \\nimmediately identify potential risks and impacts on users and for technology companies \\nto mitigate the potential dangers of deploying large language models in English and \\nnon-English contexts.\\nWHEN DEPLOYED, LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS SHOULD BE \\nACCOMPANIED BY ADEQUATE REMEDIAL CHANNELS AND \\nMECHANISMS THAT ENSURE INDIVIDUALS CAN APPEAL OUTCOMES \\nAND DECISIONS MADE BY THESE SYSTEMS.\\nBecause of the complexities of human speech and the error-prone nature of automated \\ntools, decision-making systems built on top of large language models should be used \\nwithin narrow remits and with adequate remedial channels for users encountering \\nthem. Those remedial channels and processes should have human reviewers with \\nthe same language proficiencies that their systems are deployed in. Language- and \\ncontext-specific remedial channels are particularly important for allowing users to \\nappeal decisions made by online services, especially when those decisions either restrict \\ntheir expression or access to information or fundamentally determine their access \\nto economic or social rights like the right to housing, education, and social security \\n(United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner, n.d.).\\nTechnology companies can also offer accountability at a system level, not just the \\nlevel of individual decisions. One way to do this is to conduct and publish human \\nrights impact assessments at the different phases of the language model’s life cycle \\n— development, testing, deployment, and evaluation (Prabhakaran et al., 2022). \\nPublishing human rights impact assessments will also aid in other actors’ decisions \\nwhen procuring these systems to conduct tasks in different domains and contexts. In \\nparticular, these human rights impact assessments should consider the disparate risks \\nto different language speakers in advance of a model being deployed in those languages. \\nOnline service providers can provide transparency by disclosing the systems and \\nlanguages they use large language models in. \\nLarge Language Models in Non-English Content Analysis\\n33\\nIII. Recommendations\\nCOMPANIES SHOULD INVEST IN IMPROVING LANGUAGE MODEL \\nPERFORMANCE IN INDIVIDUAL LANGUAGES BY BRINGING IN \\nLANGUAGE AND CONTEXT EXPERTS.\\nRecently, an arms race has begun between Google and Meta to see who can include \\nmore languages in their multilingual language model. Meta’s “No Language Left \\nBehind” initiative trained a model on over 200 languages (NLLB Team et al., 2022); \\nmonths later, Google one upped Meta with its “1,000 Languages Initiative” (Vincent, \\n2022). This race puts a premium on the number of languages the model trains on, \\nrather than how well it works in each language. In particular, it is unclear how these \\nmodels will handle the “curse of multilinguality,” where, as explained in II.B.3, the \\nmore languages a model trains on, the less it can capture the idiosyncrasies of each \\nlanguage. It is also unclear how these companies define a model “working” in any of \\nthese languages.\\nCompanies building large language models should not just focus on the number of \\nlanguages their model is trained on but the quality of its performance in each language. \\nIn part, that means better benchmarks, but benchmarks can only go so far. To evaluate \\nthe full range of potential applications and pitfalls that could come with applying a \\nlanguage model in a specific language context, it is necessary to involve language experts, \\ncivil society, local experts, heritage and language preservation advocates, linguists, and \\nhuman rights experts. These actors are crucial to ensuring that labeled training datasets \\nadequately capture the nuances and variations of a given language. Many organizations \\nare already doing this type of work. Uli is an example of this, where two India-based \\nnonprofit organizations — Tattle and Centre for Internet & Society — convened a \\nrange of gender, gender-based violence, communal violence, and other language experts \\nto annotate training datasets in Indian English, Tamil, and Hindi to build a tool capable \\nof parsing sentiment and toxicity on Twitter. Other researchers have also pointed to \\nusing annotators to label training datasets as a way to equip models with the ability to \\nparse variations in the speech of a certain language (Bergman & Diab, 2022; Nkemelu \\net al., 2022). \\nB. Researchers and Funders\\nRESEARCH FUNDERS SHOULD INVEST IN SPECIFIC NLP LANGUAGE \\nCOMMUNITIES TO KICKSTART THE VIRTUOUS CYCLE OF \\nDEVELOPMENT.\\nDeveloping NLP capabilities in any language is a cyclical process, and for high resource \\nlanguages — particularly English —\\xa0that cycle is virtuous. When a language has lots \\nof clean, human-annotated datasets, researchers and developers are better equipped \\nto build models and benchmarks to test models in that language. More models and \\nLost in Translation\\nCDT Research\\n34\\nbenchmarks lead to more publications, conferences, and real-world use cases. And \\nfinally, increased demand for research and software in a language drives demand for \\nmore datasets. For low resource languages, however, the virtuous cycle is hard to \\nkickstart. Without tools, annotators, and financial investment earmarked for different \\nlanguage communities, NLP researchers cannot create the datasets needed to build \\nmodels or benchmarks, and even if they could, they face difficulties publishing or \\ngetting attention for their work in popular journals and conferences. The most \\nprestigious NLP publications focus disproportionately on English; languages without \\ntheir own self-sustaining NLP communities end up to a handful of specialized outlets.\\nInvestments into non-English NLP should particularly focus on creating self-sustaining \\nscholarly NLP communities, and doing this requires investing in all levels at once. The \\ngroups that are best set up to properly allocate these investments are the language- and \\ngeography-specific NLP research communities that have cropped up over the years, \\nsuch as such as Masakhane, AmericasNLP, ARBML, and others who can convene \\npractitioners around common goals to advance the field (Alyafeai & Al-Shaibani, 2020; \\nAmericasNLP, 2022; Orife et al., 2020). These communities know what kind of data \\nsets should be built, which community actors are needed to properly vet them, and \\nwhat kind of competitions and conferences should be run to keep the virtuous cycles \\ngoing. One model for how this can work is exemplified by EVALITA, an event hosted \\nby the Italian Association for Computational Linguistics. In it, researchers first submit \\ndata sets for new language tasks, such as identifying misogyny or dating documents. \\nThen, researchers compete to train models to perform those tasks the best. Finally, \\nthose results get published, thus generating interest and attention toward Italian NLP \\nand ensuring researchers continue to build tools for the language (Basile et al., 2020).\\nPrivate companies can contribute not only by financially supporting these efforts \\nbut by sharing more of the non-English datasets they use to train their large language \\nmodels, both for transparency and to support research. Large tech companies have \\nalready shared the code for training many of their multilingual language models \\n— Meta’s XLM-R and Google’s mBERT are the subjects of most multilingual \\nmodel research in publication — and disclosed the data they train them on — \\nCommonCrawl, and\\xa0Wikipedia and BooksCorpus, respectively. However, the models \\nthat Google, Meta, OpenAI, and other large companies use in their products train on \\nother, proprietary, language data. Companies should share more of their training data, \\nboth for public accountability and to bolster research.\\nLarge language models have by and large been built by private companies, but private \\nincentives may be at odds with developing these models in safe and equitable ways. \\nGovernment investment into non-English large language model research could lead \\nto improvements in areas private companies may be underinvesting in (Mazzucato, \\n2014). DARPA’s late 2010’s LORELEI project, aimed at spurring research into low \\nLarge Language Models in Non-English Content Analysis\\n35\\nIII. Recommendations\\nresource languages to improve translation for humanitarian efforts, is a good first step, \\nbut further government incentives could help assure that NLP researchers invest in \\na broad range of approaches and languages, rather than focus disproportionately on \\nEnglish. BigScience’s BLOOM is a good example of how large language models can \\nbe developed in the open and with public support. The French government is one of \\nmany funders which has allowed BLOOM to remain open to inquiry by other NLP \\npractitioners. The multilingual language model was trained using ROOTs, a 1.6TB \\nmultilingual dataset that is clearly documented and available for NLP practitioners to \\nanalyze (Laurençon et al., 2022).\\nRESEARCHERS SHOULD FOCUS ON MEASURING AND ADDRESSING \\nTHE IMPACTS OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS.\\nTechnologists understand little about the internal logic of how large language models \\noperate and therefore have a difficult time predicting when they make mistakes, \\nwhat the effects of these mistakes will be, and how to fix them. Multilinguality only \\nexacerbates this problem. Better tools are needed to interrogate large language models, \\nparticularly multilingual language models, about why they make the decisions and \\nmistakes they do, and how to fix them.\\nIn particular, the increased use of multilingual language models has the potential to \\nhelp and harm language communities. Enabling greater digital participation amongst \\na language community raises something that researchers call the “Janus-face nature \\nof digital participation” (NLLB Team et al., 2022): it allows more to participate and \\nbenefit from the digital economy, however, it may also expose more people to the harms \\npresent online, often without their consultation and consent (Hao, 2022; Toyama, \\n2015). More research on the effects and externalities of the increased use of language \\nmodels and specifically multilingual language models must grapple with the impacts \\nthese tools have on different linguistic communities, linguistic preservation and \\ndiversity efforts, and access to opportunity for all. \\nDifferent actors have different roles to play here. Civil society has a role in documenting \\nthe impacts of these models and imagining what these “better” models should look like. \\nThere are many open questions around the types of problems that need automated \\nsolutions, what more representative datasets might look like, how to manage the tradeoffs \\nbetween languages, how large language models affect linguistic preservation efforts, and \\nwhat the rights implications are of using large language models, among other things. \\nAcademics and corporate researchers have a role in better defining the contexts and tasks \\nthese models hope to address, and developing quantitative and qualitative methods to \\nevaluate these desired normative values. And companies that deploy language models \\ncan provide researchers more transparency into how their models work, what data they \\nare trained on, and in what situations they use them so researchers can better tailor their \\nresearch to reflect what is happening in real-world systems.\\nLost in Translation\\nCDT Research\\n36\\nC. Governments\\nGOVERNMENTS SHOULD CAUTION AGAINST USING AUTOMATED \\nDECISION-MAKING SYSTEMS THAT RELY ON LARGE LANGUAGE \\nMODELS TO MAKE HIGH-STAKES DECISIONS.\\nMany governments have deployed or are considering deploying systems that use natural \\nlanguage processing technology as part of AI systems to make high-impact decisions, \\nsuch as determining immigration status or selecting judicial cases to try (Patel et al., \\n2020; Rionda & Mejia, 2021). Vendors who build these systems may soon follow the \\nlarger industry trend of incorporating large language models since they are relatively \\ncheap to build and easy to adapt as requirements change. However, as discussed \\nthroughout this paper, large language models are a relatively novel technology that has \\ntechnical limitations. These tools pose serious civil liberty concerns that are magnified \\nin non-English contexts and when used to make decisions that may affect a person’s \\nlivelihood. For instance, if a large language model is used as the basis of an algorithm \\nto evaluate affordable housing applications and the text that large language model was \\ntrained on exhibits anti-Muslim bias, the resulting affordable housing algorithm may \\ndisproportionately deny Muslims’ applications. Relying on large language models to \\nmake high-stakes decisions can have outsized, negative impacts on individuals’ lives, \\nimpeding safety and access to economic opportunities.\\nGovernments should therefore never rely solely on automated systems that incorporate \\nlarge language models to make high-risk decision-making areas, such as pretrial risk \\nassessment, allocation of social services, and immigration status. Policymakers should \\nconsider the impact on rights and access to services when procuring new tools and \\nvendors to build these systems and conduct and disclose any assessments conducted \\non these systems. They should also be cautious when adopting these systems for \\ninformation sharing services, such as chatbots about social services or that provide \\nhealthcare information, and test them extensively in every language in which they are \\ndeployed, and never use them to entirely replace human intermediaries.\\nGOVERNMENTS SHOULD NOT MANDATE OR INADVERTENTLY \\nREQUIRE BY LAW THE USE OF AUTOMATED CONTENT ANALYSIS \\nSYSTEMS TO DETECT OR REMOVE CONTENT IN ANY LANGUAGE.\\nGovernments around the world are increasingly pressuring online service providers to \\nlimit content they find to be inaccurate or harmful, such as misinformation related to \\nhealth care, or preemptively monitor online speech which may incite violence. Given \\nthe scale of content available on social media and other services, this has driven an \\ninterest amongst governments to mandate that online service providers use automated \\ncontent analysis systems to detect or remove content they deem as “illegal” or harmful \\nto their constituents.\\nLarge Language Models in Non-English Content Analysis\\n37\\nIII. Recommendations\\nThis is ill-advised. Mandating the use of automated content moderation technologies \\nor requiring companies to take down content in a limited time period (effectively \\nrequiring the use of automated technologies) opens the door for the overbroad removal \\nof speech. Large language models, especially in non-English language contexts, are not \\na magical technology that can perfectly distinguish between “good” and “bad” speech. \\nAt best, they are an imprecise technology that fails to understand the context of speech \\n— for instance, when an individual uses a slur versus when a journalist documents \\nthe use of a slur by that individual. At worst, they are tools that can be appropriated \\nby governments to squash dissent and freedom of expression. Efforts to persuade tech \\ncompanies to improve their automated systems, clarify their policies, introduce more \\naccountability, and promote parity between languages are all welcome, but requiring \\ncompanies to adopt certain technologies is not an effective way to achieve those ends.\\nINTERNATIONAL AND MULTILATERAL STANDARDS BODIES, \\nREGULATORY AGENCIES, AND OTHERS SHOULD CONVENE \\nMULTI-STAKEHOLDER DISCUSSIONS ABOUT STANDARDS AND \\nGUARDRAILS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF LARGE \\nLANGUAGE MODELS.\\nThe norms around when and how multilingual language models should be deployed \\nare very much in flux. Those norms so far have mostly been established implicitly by \\ntechnology companies in the ways they build and deploy these models, but trends in \\nthese norms may be at odds with the public interest. For instance, OpenAI revealed \\nsome information about the training data they used for GPT-3 but almost nothing \\nabout GPT-4; Open AI co-founder Ilya Sutskever described having shared information \\nabout GPT-3’s training data as “just not wise” and something the company would \\nunlikely do again (Vincent, 2023b).\\nCompanies should not have a monopoly on the norms around language models. \\nGovernmental and nongovernmental\\xa0convening bodies need to organize and push back \\nto establish counter-norms that better serve the public’s interests. This field is early on \\nenough that these bodies should discuss what positive outcomes even look like. Users \\naffected by the deployment of large language models need to be at the table for those \\nconversations. Government agencies and multilateral organizations (e.g. the Internet \\nEngineering Task Force, United Nations) can play a coordinating role to get together \\nthe relevant stakeholders to come up with such standards.\\nThere are also larger questions to reckon with when it comes to the use of large \\nlanguage models in non-English contexts. At once, companies are increasingly \\ndeploying multilingual language models to bridge the gap between the functionality in \\nEnglish and other languages across a myriad of tasks, such as harmful content detection, \\nsentiment analysis, and content scanning. However, as we show in this paper, these \\nmultilingual systems are relatively new and perform inconsistently across languages. \\nLost in Translation\\nCDT Research\\n38\\nIf deployed prematurely and without guardrails, these models pose real risks to \\nindividuals around the world and in particular their ability to express themselves freely. \\nThese risks have the potential to compound existing challenges in the information \\nenvironment for individuals in Western democracies where there are real vacuums of \\navailable information in languages other than English and in countries in the Global \\nSouth where there are already real threats to the free expression and exchange of \\ninformation posed by majoritarian and institutional powers (Golebiewski & boyd, \\n2018). Alternatively, companies may decide to only roll out systems that have been \\nfine-tuned for English and wait until there is enough data and tooling available for non-\\nEnglish language tools — something that will take an enormous amount of financial \\ninvestment, time, effort, and rare consensus — further entrenching the digital divide \\nand Anglocentrism present online. Both scenarios are lose-lose for all speakers on the \\nweb. This is a wicked problem and the current incentives are at play to build bigger \\nmodels, and with more languages. Multi-stakeholder bodies are much better positioned \\nthan companies to determine when the risks associated with building larger, more \\nmultilingual language models are worth taking.\\nLarge Language Models in Non-English Content Analysis\\n39\\nWorks Cited\\nAbid, A., Farooqi, M., & Zou, J.

While extreme-scale\\nlanguage models such as GPT-3 offer multilingual capabilities, zero-shot learning for languages\\nother than English remain largely unexplored. Here, we introduce Cedille, a large open source\\nauto-regressive language model, speciﬁcally trained for the French language. Our results show that\\nCedille outperforms existing French language models and is competitive with GPT-3 on a range\\nof French zero-shot benchmarks. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth comparison of the toxicity\\nexhibited by these models, showing that Cedille marks an improvement in language model safety\\nthanks to dataset ﬁltering.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nLarge autoregressive language models have drawn wide\\nattention due to their zero-shot and few-shot capabilities,\\nallowing them to be used for a wide variety of Natural Lan-\\nguage Processing tasks without the need for task-speciﬁc\\nﬁnetuning or annotation data [1, 2]. Additionally, previ-\\nous work highlights the improved sample and compute\\nefﬁciency of larger models, generally justifying the move\\ntowards larger models [3].\\nAlthough large language models, such as GPT-3 [2], have\\nbeen trained on multilingual corpuses, the performance on\\nNLP tasks may vary signiﬁcantly between languages. As-\\nsessing zero-shot performance in non-English languages\\nis challenging due to the limited number of human-curated\\nbenchmarks available. However, with the exception of re-\\ncent work in machine translation [4], multilingual models\\ngenerally perform worse than mono- or bilingual language\\nmodels [5].\\nMonolingual autoregressive language models in French\\nhave previously been proposed. GPT-fr [6] and PAGnol [7]\\nhave been trained on ﬁltered versions of Common Crawl2\\nand CCNet [8], respectively. Both works highlight the im-\\nportance of deduplicating and ﬁltering of pre-training data\\nand use decoder-only transformer architectures, closely\\nfollowing the GPT models with model sizes reaching 1B\\nand 1.5B parameters, respectively. It’s worth noting that\\nthese works do not directly compare performance against\\nextreme-scale large multilingual models, such as GPT-3,\\nin particular with regard to zero-shot tasks.\\nPrevious work on the various encoding biases in large lan-\\nguage models highlights the importance of dataset curation\\nand documentation [9, 10]. Experiments conducted on\\nGPT-3 (which has been trained on 570GB of text data\\nfrom Common Crawl) show that the model may gener-\\nate toxic sentences even when prompted with non-toxic\\ntext [11]. Although applying ﬁltering of training data using\\nautomated toxicity scores may introduce classiﬁer-speciﬁc\\nbiases [12], this technique remains more effective than\\n∗Authors contributed equally, order is random\\n1Coteries SA, EPFL Innovation Park, Lausanne, Switzerland\\n2https://commoncrawl.org/\\narXiv:2202.03371v1  [cs.CL]  7 Feb 2022\\ndecoder-based detoxiﬁcation using methods such as swear\\nword ﬁlters, PPLM [13], soft prompt tuning [14] or toxicity\\ncontrol tokens [15].\\nAs a consequence of the aforementioned risks, the trend\\ntowards larger models coincides with a trend to not release\\nmodels publicly. Controlling access to large language mod-\\nels may protect against certain bad actors but also limits\\nreproducibility and research efforts to mitigate the negative\\nproperties of such models. In a push for building models in\\nthe open, EleutherAI, a grassroot collective of researchers,\\nreleased GPT-J [16], a 6B parameter English language\\nmodel. This model was trained on the Pile [20], a 825GB\\ntext corpus by the same collective.\\nThe contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) We intro-\\nduce Cedille, an openly available French language model\\nbuilt on GPT-J, which is capable of achieving competitive\\nzero-shot performance against existing French language\\nmodels and GPT-3. (2) We release the toxicity scores\\nof the complete French C4 dataset, and (3) we provide a\\ncomparison of Cedille’s toxicity to other language models\\n(including GPT-3).\\n2\\nMethods\\n2.1\\nModel architecture\\nOur model architecture is identical to GPT-J [16]. GPT-J\\nuses a similar transformer architecture to the one used in\\n6.7B GPT-3 with three main differences: (1) No sparse\\nattention patterns were used; (2) the dimension of the atten-\\ntion head was increased from 128 to 256; and (3) Rotary\\npositional embeddings [17] were used instead of sinusoidal\\nembeddings. See Table 1 for more details.\\nNumber of parameters\\n6,053,381,344\\nNumber of layers N\\n28\\nModel dimensions dmodel\\n4096\\nFeed-forward dimension dff\\n16,384\\nNumber of attention heads nheads\\n16\\nHead dimension dhead\\n256\\nContext size\\n2048\\nVocab size\\n50,257\\nTable 1: Cedille model details.\\n2.2\\nTraining data\\nCedille is trained on a ﬁltered version of the French part\\nof the multilingual C4 (mC4) dataset [18], which contains\\n332M documents or 1.1TB of uncompressed text. mC4 is\\nextracted from 71 Common Crawl snapshots (years 2013\\nto 2020) and uses CLD33, a small feed-forward neural net-\\nwork, for language identiﬁcation. mC4 ﬁltered out pages\\nof less than three lines of at least 200 characters.\\nWe apply two different forms of ﬁltering to the dataset 1)\\ntoxicity ﬁltering using the Detoxify model [19] and 2) loss\\nﬁltering using the FlauBERT model [20]. For both ﬁltering\\nsteps we compute the metric on a per document level of the\\nentire base dataset. In some cases chunking the documents\\ninto splits of 1200 characters was necessary due to the\\nﬁxed context size of the used models. Chunks smaller than\\n600 characters were not evaluated. The predictions were\\nrun on TPU v3-8 machines with 8-fold data parallelism\\neach.\\nEach percentile as well as the tails of both the loss and the\\ntoxicity distribution were sampled and manually inspected\\nto ﬁnd suitable cut-off values for ﬁltering. The inspection\\nof these samples revealed that both toxicity and loss values\\nwere appropriate4. We removed documents correspond-\\ning to a toxicity score higher than 0.5, corresponding to\\n0.25% of the content (0.8M documents). For the loss ﬁl-\\ntering we considered the loss distribution of each of the\\n2048 ﬁles and removed documents below a 0.2 percentile\\nloss (corresponding to a loss value of roughly 4.5) and\\nabove an absolute loss value of 10. This corresponded to\\na removal of roughly 20% of all documents (66M docu-\\nments). The combined ﬁltering led to a ﬁnal training set of\\n265M documents, which corresponds to roughly 773GB\\nof uncompressed text.\\nThe text was then run through the fix_text method of\\nthe Python library ftfy [21] using NFKC normalization\\nand encoded using the unmodiﬁed GPT-2 tokenizer. Docu-\\nments were simply concatenated and split into samples of\\n2049 tokens. The ﬁnal training set yielded a total of 130M\\nsamples corresponding to 268B tokens.\\n2.3\\nTraining process\\nCedille was trained starting from the ofﬁcial GPT-J model\\ncheckpoint using the mesh-transformer-jax codebase [22].\\nTraining was conducted on a v3-128 TPU VM using 16-\\nfold data parallelism and 8-fold model sharding. For all\\nour experiments we used an effective batch size of 256.\\nWe used a linear warmup of 42k steps up to a peak learning\\nrate of 5e-5 and a cosine decay to 1e-5. Weight decay was\\nset to 0.1. Cedille was trained for 150k steps, which corre-\\nsponds to 0.3 epochs on the training set or 78.7B tokens.\\nThe starting and ﬁnal training perplexities were 6.13 and\\n3.89, respectively. During training we monitored the loss\\non a dataset of French news stories published too recently\\nto be part of the training data.\\n3https://github.com/google/cld3\\n4Despite the positive visual inspection a bug in the loss computation was discovered much later in the analysis. Further investiga-\\ntion revealed that roughly 10% of samples were wrongly included in the ﬁnal dataset as a result. Although it cannot be fully ruled\\nout we do not believe that a systematic bias was introduced.\\n2\\n2.4\\nEvaluation\\nZero-shot performance was evaluated using a forked ver-\\nsion of the lm-evaluation-harness codebase [23]. In par-\\nticular, we added a different way of evaluating perplexity\\nusing strides (see section 3.1), implemented the various\\nbenchmarks discussed in this work, and integrated the\\nmesh-transformer-jax library (for evaluating checkpoints\\non TPUs) and the Pagnol model families. Benchmarking\\nwas conducted on v3-8 TPU VMs and on A100 GPUs.\\nToxicity evaluation was conducted using a modiﬁed ver-\\nsion of the real-toxicity-prompts codebase5. The main\\ndifference is the use of the Detoxify model in order\\nto predict toxicity (see section 4).\\nOur adapted code-\\nbase is available at https://github.com/coteries/\\nreal-toxicity-prompts.\\n3\\nTasks\\n3.1\\nPerplexity\\nModel\\n#params\\nByte-PPL\\nToken-PPL\\nGPT-3 (ada)\\n1.3Ba\\n1.930\\n7.952\\nGPT-3 (babbage)\\n6.7B\\n1.973\\n6.447\\nGPT-3 (curie)\\n13B\\n1.809\\n5.082\\nGPT-3 (davinci)\\n175B\\n1.656\\n3.993\\nGPT-J\\n6.05B\\n1.746\\n5.797\\nCedille\\n6.05B\\n1.646\\n3.932\\nPagnol (small)\\n124M\\n1.852\\n17.802\\nPagnol (medium)\\n335M\\n1.775\\n14.623\\nPagnol (large)\\n773M\\n1.725\\n12.791\\nGPT-fr (base)\\n1B\\n2.090\\n11.882\\nTable 2: Byte-level and token-level perplexity scores on the\\nWikiText-fr benchmark (lower is better).\\naOpenAI hasn’t ofﬁcially disclosed the size of the models\\nprovided by their API, however recent experiments suggest the\\nmapping presented in the table [24].\\nZero-shot perplexity was evaluated on the test subset of\\nthe WikiText-fr6 dataset [6], containing articles from the\\nFrench Wikipedia which are part of the “quality articles” or\\n“good articles” categories, similar to the English WikiText-\\n103 dataset [25]. The test set contains 589k words or 3.7M\\ncharacters of cleaned French text from 60 articles. We eval-\\nuated perplexity by concatenating the text without further\\npreprocessing and using a sliding window approach [26]\\nwith a stride of 512 tokens. Therefore models with a con-\\ntext window of 1024 tokens (GPT-fr, Pagnol) had 512\\ntokens of context, whereas models with a context window\\nof 2048 tokens had 1536 tokens of context. Table 2 shows\\nthe summed log likelihoods both normalized by number\\nof characters and by number of tokens. Note that the\\ntoken-level perplexity for GPT-fr and Pagnol is not directly\\ncomparable to the other models, as they are not using the\\n(English) GPT-2 tokenizer.\\nCedille achieves the lowest perplexity score out of the an-\\nalyzed models, clearly outcompeting existing French lan-\\nguage models and narrowly outcompeting GPT-3 (davinci).\\nUnsurprisingly, models with larger context windows gen-\\nerally perform better at this task. It is noteworthy that the\\ntest dataset is likely contained in the training data as no\\ndataset-speciﬁc ﬁltering of the training data was conducted\\nas part of this work.\\n3.2\\nSummarization\\nWe evaluated the summarization capabilities on the Orange-\\nSum benchmark, as introduced in the BARThez work [27]\\nas a French equivalent of XSum [28]. The benchmark con-\\ntains news articles published between February 2011 and\\nSeptember 2020, scraped from the French website “Orange\\nActu”. The models were given the news article in the test\\nsubset using the following prompt:\\n{article text}\\\\nPour résumer :\\nThe models were tasked to generate 100 tokens using top-k\\nof 2 and a temperature of 1, following the methodology\\nin [1]. We used greedy decoding (top-k = 1) for GPT-3,\\nsince at the time of this work being conducted, the API\\ndidn’t allow for other top-k values. When the prompt ex-\\nceeded the context window of the model it was left-side\\ntruncated. The output was then clipped to contain at most 3\\nsentences (using simplistic sentence splitting at the period\\ncharacter). Table 3 shows the ROUGE score [29] of the\\noutput compared to the title of the corresponding articles.\\nModel\\nR1\\nR2\\nRL\\nGPT-3 (ada)\\n13.95\\n4.75\\n11.59\\nGPT-3 (babbage)\\n4.62\\n1.76\\n3.86\\nGPT-3 (curie)\\n5.28\\n2.21\\n4.42\\nGPT-3 (davinci)\\n15.49\\n5.82\\n13.05\\nGPT-J\\n14.46\\n4.72\\n11.68\\nCedille\\n14.74\\n4.83\\n11.86\\nPagnol (small)\\n8.52\\n1.61\\n7.24\\nPagnol (medium)\\n8.98\\n1.86\\n7.55\\nPagnol (large)\\n9.19\\n1.85\\n7.71\\nGPT-fr (base)\\n10.15\\n2.60\\n8.27\\nTable 3: Performance of summarization in French.

However, computational limi-\\n5https://github.com/allenai/real-toxicity-prompts\\n6https://huggingface.co/datasets/asi/wikitext_fr\\n3\\ntations and cost made it difﬁcult to estimate this variance.\\nWe also observed that the choice of the preﬁx (“Pour ré-\\nsumer :”) strongly inﬂuences the scores. Some of the\\nevaluated models are also more likely to generate bullet\\npoint summaries, rather than a single sentence, which may\\nagain lead to different sentence splitting. This may ex-\\nplain the increased score for GPT-3 (ada) compared to\\nlarger GPT-3 models. Nevertheless, the scores provided\\nin Table 3 give some rough indication of summarization\\nperformance.\\n3.3\\nQuestion Answering (QA)\\nQuestion answering (QA) was evaluated on FQuAD\\n(French Question Answering Dataset) [30], a dataset in-\\nspired by the English SQuAD equivalent [31]. The models\\nwere evaluated on the validation subset, which contains\\n3188 human-curated question-answer pairs, based on 768\\nhigh-quality French Wikipedia articles.\\nModel\\nF1\\nExact match (%)\\nGPT-3 (ada)\\n19.09\\n4.48\\nGPT-3 (babbage)\\n26.16\\n8.81\\nGPT-3 (curie)\\n39.49\\n17.84\\nGPT-3 (davinci)\\n-\\n-\\nGPT-J\\n26.14\\n6.96\\nCedille\\n34.59\\n12.23\\nPagnol (small)\\n10.66\\n0.43\\nPagnol (medium)\\n13.80\\n0.84\\nPagnol (large)\\n17.67\\n2.72\\nGPT-fr (base)\\n15.15\\n2.03\\nTable 4: Question-answering F1 and exact match scores in\\nFrench on the FQuAD benchmark (higher is better).\\nThe models were evaluated using the SQuAD v2 met-\\nric [31], which also takes into consideration “no answer”\\nprobabilities, i.e. cases when no answer to a particular\\nquestion is possible given the context. The models were\\ntasked to generate 100 tokens and at most 1 sentence using\\ngreedy sampling and the following prompt:\\nTitre:\\n{title}\\\\nContexte:\\n{context}\\\\n\\\\n\\nQuestion:\\n{question}\\\\n\\\\nRéponse:\\nThe “no answer” probabilities were calculated against the\\nstring:\\n{prompt} Sans réponse.\\nHowever, all questions in the evaluated data contained\\nexactly one answer.\\nThe results in Table 4 show that GPT-3 is very competitive\\non this task, with GPT-3 (curie) outperforming Cedille\\nand all other evaluated models. GPT-3 (davinci) was not\\nevaluated on this task for cost reasons, as OpenAI did not\\nsupport our request for funding at the time of writing. The\\nresults may be contrasted to a ﬁnetuned version of Camem-\\nBERT [32] which yields F1 of 88% and best match of 78%\\non this dataset [30].\\n3.4\\nTranslation\\nZero-shot translation was evaluated for the language pair\\nEnglish and French on the WMT14 dataset [33]. Tradi-\\ntionally, such benchmarks are evaluated using the BLEU\\nscore [34]. The datasets contains 3003 samples each and\\nare provided by the sacrebleu library [35]. The zero-shot\\ntask is formulated using the following pattern:\\n{source_lang} phrase:\\n{text}\\\\n{target_lang}\\nphrase:\\nWhere source_lang and target_lang are French and\\nEnglish, respectively, depending on the direction. Greedy\\nsampling is used to generate 256 tokens. The output was\\nclipped to at most 1 sentence.\\nCedille outperforms other models for the direction English\\nto French, highlighting the strong French writing capabil-\\nities (see Table 5). Likewise, GPT-3 (davinci) performs\\nbetter for the French to English direction. Monolingual\\nmodels, such as Pagnol and GPT-fr perform worse at this\\ntask presumably due to the limited amount of English that\\nwas part of their pretraining data. Often, smaller models\\nwere unable to follow the instructions and simply repeated\\nthe context in the given language. As opposed to summa-\\nrization and question-answering benchmarks, the target is\\ngenerally not part of the context, therefore simply repeating\\nthe input normally results in a low score.\\nAs of 2021, dedicated neural machine translation solutions,\\nsuch as Very Deep Transformers, reach 46.4 BLEU for\\nEnglish to French translation [36].\\nModel\\nBLEU (en→fr)\\nBLEU (fr→en)\\nGPT-3 (ada)\\n2.71\\n16.64\\nGPT-3 (babbage)\\n3.20\\n24.56\\nGPT-3 (curie)\\n13.45\\n27.15\\nGPT-3 (davinci)\\n20.40\\n27.70\\nGPT-J\\n14.71\\n26.06\\nCedille\\n24.89\\n20.59\\nPagnol (small)\\n0.76\\n1.20\\nPagnol (medium)\\n1.07\\n1.48\\nPagnol (large)\\n1.06\\n3.47\\nGPT-fr (base)\\n1.47\\n1.57\\nTable 5: BLEU scores for ranslation on WMT14 for the English-\\nFrench language pair (higher is better).\\n4\\nToxicity analysis\\nIn order to evaluate the toxicity of the model we closely\\nfollowed the work conducted in [11]. We studied the case\\n4\\nof unprompted (i.e. conditioned only on a start-of-sentence\\ntoken) and prompted generation.\\nThe original work in [11] used the Perspective API, a ser-\\nvice that uses machine learning classiﬁers to estimate the\\nperceived toxicity of text. In this work, we employ the\\nDetoxify tool [19] instead. We made this choice as the\\nunderlying models used by Perspective evolve with time\\nand are not released publicly, which limits experimental\\nreproducibility.\\nDetoxify assigns a toxicity score between 0 and 1, with 1\\ndenoting “a very hateful, aggressive, or disrespectful com-\\nment”. We refer to content with a score > 0.5 as “toxic”.\\nWe use the “multilingual” Detoxify model from release\\nv0.4.0, and compare the toxicity of Cedille output to 3\\nother models: GPT-2 (117M), GPT-3 (davinci), GPT-J and\\nGPT-fr (base).\\n4.1\\nUnprompted toxicity\\nFor the unprompted toxicity we analyze the expected max-\\nimum toxicity, i.e. the expected worst-case toxicity score\\ngiven N unprompted generations. Figure 1 shows boot-\\nstrap estimates (1000 iterations) of the expected maximum\\ntoxicity for N generations with variance bounds as shades.\\nIn this setting, Cedille consistently generates content with\\nlower expected maximum toxicity than GPT-2, GPT-J, and\\nGPT-3. After 100 generations, this value is under 0.5 for\\nGPT-fr and Cedille (0.41 and 0.48, respectively), which\\nmeans that the worst content from these models is not\\nexpected to be toxic. This is in contrast with the other\\nmodels, for which maximum expected toxicity values are\\n0.64, 0.54 and 0.56.\\nAfter 10K generations, Cedille and GPT-fr are the only\\nmodels for which the expected worst outputs don’t reach\\na toxicity level of 1.0 We expect all other models to have\\nat least one output that is maximally toxic as detected by\\nDetoxify. Generally the two models that perform best are\\nGPT-fr and Cedille, which were both trained on carefully\\nﬁltered datasets, pointing to the importance of dataset cu-\\nration when considering the safety of language models.\\nWithout any conditioning, the multilingual models almost\\nexclusively generate English content: this is the case of\\nGPT-2, GPT-J and GPT-3. However, with the Detoxify\\nmodel being multilingual, the toxicity scores remain com-\\nparable.\\n4.2\\nPrompted toxicity\\nFor prompted toxicity we used a set of 50 French prompts\\nwith values of toxicity spanning the full range, with a mean\\nof 0.34. The set of prompts was selected randomly from\\nthe RealToxicityPrompt dataset and manually translated\\nfrom English to French by a French native speaker. We\\nused a smaller number of prompts than in [11] due to lim-\\nited computing resources. The French prompts cause the\\nmultilingual models (GPT-2, GPT-J and GPT-3) to gener-\\nate French content. For each prompt, each model generates\\n50 completions. We used nucleus sampling with p = 0.9\\nto generate up to 20 tokens per continuation, following the\\nprotocol from [11].\\nTable 6 shows two properties: 1) the expected maximum\\ntoxicity over 25 generations (with standard deviations in\\nparentheses) and 2) the empirical probability of generating\\ntoxic text at least once among 25 generations.\\nModel\\nExp. max tox.\\nProb. toxicity\\nGPT-2a\\n0.63 (0.23)\\n0.66\\nGPT-3 (davinci)\\n0.68 (0.27)\\n0.74\\nGPT-J\\n0.73 (0.26)\\n0.78\\nCedille\\n0.66 (0.27)\\n0.72\\nGPT-fr (base)\\n0.73 (0.27)\\n0.78\\nTable 6: Toxicity of prompted generations.\\naUpon manual inspection, it appeared that GPT-2 is unable\\nto generate sensible French content, and as such the resulting\\ntoxicity values can’t be compared to other models.\\nFor both properties, Cedille outperforms the other models.\\nWe can see again that Cedille is less toxic than GPT-J,\\nindicating that the training not only improved the model’s\\nFrench capabilities, but also increased its safety.\\n5\\nConclusions\\nIn this work we introduced Cedille, a large auto-regressive\\nFrench language model.\\nOur work shows that mono-\\nlingual models such as Cedille, can be competitive com-\\npared to extreme scale multilingual language models, i.e.\\nGPT-3. Compared to existing French language models,\\nCedille is capable of performing well on zero-shot natural\\nlanguage understanding tasks and reaches a new state-of-\\nthe-art perplexity score on the French WikiText corpus.\\nLastly, our approach of toxicity ﬁltering of the training\\ndata led to a decrease in both maximum toxicity as well as\\nthe likelihood of toxic output.\\nAs a result of the ﬁnetuning approach starting from GPT-J,\\nCedille has been exposed to a large amount of both English\\nand French language data from the Pile and French mC4.\\nThis combination allows for competitive zero-shot trans-\\nlation scores for the French-English language pair. Early\\nexperiments indicate that ﬁnetuning an existing English\\nlanguage model and adapting it to French is more efﬁcient\\neven with considerable compute and data investments (see\\nappendix).\\nGiven the scarcity of high-quality human-curated datasets\\nin non-English languages it is especially challenging to\\nprovide a fair comparison of language models. For the\\nzero-shot benchmarks we observed a high degree of sen-\\nsitivity towards evaluation settings such as preﬁxes, sam-\\npling parameters, and type of evaluation metric.

In this\\nwork we haven’t provided performance metrics for other\\nNLP tasks such as text classiﬁcation or word sense disam-\\nbiguation. Furthermore, this work focused on zero-shot\\nevaluation, ignoring few-shot or ﬁnetuning approaches.\\nApart from training larger models, a possible path for-\\nward is to deduplicate training data. This method has been\\nshown to improve end-task performance signiﬁcantly [8,\\n37] but was not conducted as part of this work.

These models have been shown\\nto yield good performance, using in-context learning, even on unseen tasks and\\nlanguages. They have also been exposed as commercial APIs as a form of\\nlanguage-model-as-a-service, with great adoption. However, their performance on\\nAfrican languages is largely unknown.

These models\\nhave been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performances on several tasks. More recently, focus has\\nshifted from the pretrain-ﬁnetune paradigm (Howard & Ruder, 2018; Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al.,\\n2019; Raffel et al., 2020) to in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2021; Wei et al.,\\n2022a; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022; Dong et al., 2023). In-context\\nlearning proves that prompting large language models with some task-speciﬁc examples allows them\\nperform well on test examples of that task, all without updating the model’s parameters. This has\\nled to reduced computation costs and has made it possible to create language-models-as-a-service\\n(Sun et al., 2022), in the form of commercial Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Com-\\nmercial language models have become very prevalent. For context, the recently released ChatGPT1\\namassed 100 million users2 in two months, making it the fastest growing consumer app in recent\\nhistory. Given their dominance and inevitable continual rise, it is important to understand how these\\nmodels perform on African languages. Hence, we present a preliminary effort to close this gap by\\nevaluating two commercial large language models using in-context learning on African languages.\\nEvaluation is performed on two tasks - text classiﬁcation and machine translation. Our experiments,\\nspanning 8 African languages from different language families and geographical locations, suggests\\nthat commercial language models do not perform well on African languages. In particular, we note\\na large disparity in performance, depending on the evaluation task - models perform better on text\\nclassiﬁcation than machine translation. Our work sheds light on the need to ensure the inclusion\\nof African languages in the development of commercial language models, given their inevitable\\nadoption in our daily lives.\\n1https://chat.openai.com/\\n2https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/02/chatgpt-100-million-users-open-ai-faste\\n1\\nAfricaNLP workshop at ICLR2022\\n2\\nRELATED WORK\\n2.1\\nIN-CONTEXT LEARNING\\nThe use of pretrained language models has become the de-facto approach to solving natural language\\nprocessing (NLP) tasks. Previous models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al.,\\n2019) and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) largely follow a pretrain-ﬁnetune setting (Howard & Ruder,\\n2018). In this method, the pretrained model is ﬁnetuned on a downstream task, such as text classi-\\nﬁcation, and then used for that task. While this works very well, it has several downsides. For one,\\nﬁnetuned models are usually task-speciﬁc and this means one has to maintain separate models for\\nseparate tasks. Furthermore, the growing size of pretrained language models (Kaplan et al., 2020)\\nmeans that it is becoming increasingly expensive to ﬁnetune such gigantic models. One solution\\nthat has proven popular in recent times is in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020; Schick & Sch¨utze,\\n2021; Wei et al., 2022a; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022; Dong et al.,\\n2023). The core idea behind this method is to enable pretrained language models learn from ex-\\namples within the context. In this setting, a user prompts a pretrained language model with a few\\nlabelled examples of a task following a speciﬁc pattern, and unlabelled examples that need to be pre-\\ndicted on (Wei et al., 2022c; Liu et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022b). In-context learning can also work\\nin a zero-shot setting where no labelled examples are included in the prompt. In-context learning\\nworks surprisingly well and is very efﬁcient since there is no update to the model’s parameters. As\\na result, computation costs are signiﬁcantly reduced and it becomes possible to expose language\\nmodels as a service (Sun et al., 2022). Commercial APIs are heavily reliant on in-context learning\\nas this is the primary method through which users interact 3 with the models4.\\n2.2\\nMULTILINGUAL IN-CONTEXT LEARNING\\nLarge language models have proven successful in multilingual settings.\\nLin et al. (2021) train\\nseveral multilingual models, of which the largest one (7.5B parameters) sets a state-of-the-art in\\nfew-shot learning on more than 20 languages. Their model outperforms GPT3 on several mul-\\ntilingual tasks. Muennighoff et al. (2022) perform multitask prompted ﬁnetuning on multilingual\\npretrained language models and observe impressive zero-shot generalization to tasks in unseen lan-\\nguages. Following ﬁndings from Blevins & Zettlemoyer (2022) that non-English dataset present in\\nthe pretraining corpora of English language models explains their surprising cross-lingual ability,\\nChowdhery et al. (2022) deliberately introduce non-English corpora (≈22%) into the pretraining\\ncorpora of their PaLM model and achieve impressive few-shot multilingual performance. Shi et al.\\n(2022) evaluate GPT3 and PaLM on a newly introduced grade school mathematics multilingual\\nbenchmark. They ﬁnd that using prompts with intermediate reasoning steps in English consistently\\nled to competitive or better results than those written in the native language of the question. They\\nalso set a new state-of-the-art on a common-sense reasononing multilingual benchmark, XCOPA\\n(Ponti et al., 2020), using few-shot examples. Zhao & Sch¨utze (2021) show that prompting yields\\nbetter cross-lingual transfer in few-shot settings than ﬁnetuning and in-language training of multilin-\\ngual natural language inference. Furthermore, Winata et al. (2021) evaluate the multilingual ability\\nof GPT (Radford et al., 2019) and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) models on multi-class text classiﬁcation,\\nand ﬁnd that they work well on non-English languages given a few English examples. Concurrent\\nwork (Jiao et al., 2023) evaluate ChatGPT on machine translation and ﬁnd that, while it is compet-\\nitive with other commercial translation APIs such as Google translate5, it is less robust on other\\ndomains such as biomedical. Another concurrent work (Zhang et al., 2023) conducts a study on\\nthe performance of GLM (Zeng et al., 2022) on machine translation. They note several interesting\\nﬁndings on the effect of prompt template, examples and language. Despite the plethora of works\\non multilingual prompting, little to no African languages are usually contained in the evaluation\\nsets of nearly all of these works. When present, they are often obtained by translating the existing\\ndatasets of other languages (Yu et al., 2022) This method has been shown to contain artifacts that\\ncan inﬂate the performance of models evaluated on such datasets (Artetxe et al., 2020). Our work is\\northogonal to all of this works because we focus solely on commercial language model APIs, given\\ntheir prevalence. The closest to our work is concurrent by Abott et al. (2023), who evaluate GPT\\n3https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/completion/prompt-design\\n4https://docs.cohere.ai/docs/prompt-engineering\\n5https://translate.google.com/\\n2\\nAfricaNLP workshop at ICLR2022\\n3.5 on Named Entity Recognition and Machine Translation on only isiZulu. However, our work is\\ndifferent from this as we compare two commercial APIs in the evaluation of text classiﬁcation and\\nMachine Translation across 8 African language.\\n3\\nMETHODOLOGY\\n3.1\\nDATASETS\\nEvaluation is done on two tasks - text classiﬁcation and machine translation.\\n3.1.1\\nTEXT CLASSIFICATION\\nWe use the news topic classiﬁcation datasets from Hedderich et al. (2020) and Alabi et al. (2022).\\nWe select the Hausa (hau) language from Hedderich et al. (2020) which has 5 categories. Pretrained\\nlanguage models have been shown to work very well on this dataset in both few and zero-shot\\nsettings. The dataset from Alabi et al. (2022) covers ﬁve languages, out of which we select four\\n- Nigerian Pidgin (pcm), Malagasay (mlg), and Somali (som), isiZulu (zul). Each language has 5\\ncategories, except Somali which has 6. For both datasets, we use the train, validation and test splits\\nas released by the authors. We select these languages because they cover different language families\\nand geographical areas.\\n3.1.2\\nMACHINE TRANSLATION\\nWe use the MAFAND-MT machine translation dataset from Adelani et al. (2022) which covers 16\\nAfrican languages. Running translation on commercial APIs is cumbersome and expensive, hence\\nwe select 5 languages from the 16. The ﬁve languages are isiZulu (zul), Yoruba (yor), Nigerian\\nPidgin (pcm), Swahili (Swa) and Lugala (lug). We use the splits as released by the authors.\\n3.2\\nMODELS\\nTwo commercial APIs6 are considered: ChatGPT7 and Cohere8. We consider both these APIs be-\\ncause they are arguably the most popular ones9. ChatGPT is based on the Instruct-GPT models\\n(Ouyang et al., 2022). It is optimized for conversations and has been shown to be capable of sev-\\neral NLP tasks including text classiﬁcation, machine translation, question answering, and so on.\\nWe use Cohere’s multilingual model10 which is based on their multilingual embedding model11.\\nThe embedding model supports 100 languages, including 15 African languages. All the languages\\nwe consider, except Nigerian Pidgin, are supported by the model. However, given the linguistic\\nproximity of Nigerian Pidgin to English (Faraclas, 2008; Ogueji & Ahia, 2019; Chang et al., 2020;\\nAhia & Ogueji, 2020a; Lent et al., 2021; 2022), the model should be able to perform well on the\\ndataset.\\n3.3\\nPROMPTING AND EVALUATION\\nWe describe our prompting and evaluation approaches for text classiﬁcation and machine translation.\\n3.3.1\\nTEXT CLASSIFICATION\\nFor Cohere, we use the Classify12 endpoint and follow the format speciﬁed in the API documenta-\\ntion13. When using ChatGPT, we design several prompts ourselves and we also ask ChatGPT for\\n6Experiments were run between January 22, 2023 and February 5, 2023.\\n7https://chat.openai.com/\\n8https://www.cohere.ai\\n9https://venturebeat.com/uncategorized/openai-rival-cohere-launches-language-model-api/\\n10https://docs.cohere.ai/changelog/multilingual-support-for-coclassify\\n11https://docs.cohere.ai/docs/multilingual-language-models\\n12https://api.cohere.ai/classify\\n13https://docs.cohere.ai/reference/classify\\n3\\nAfricaNLP workshop at ICLR2022\\nthe best prompt for classiﬁcation, following concurrent work (Jiao et al., 2023). We perform some\\ninitial evaluation of the prompts and select the best one.\\nOur best prompt is shown below:\\nGiven the following news headlines and their categories:\\nText:\\n{Sentence}\\nCategory:\\n{Label}\\nPlease classify the following news headlines into one of:\\n{Label List}.\\nText:\\n{Sentence}\\nCategory:\\nWhere Sentence is the news headline to be classiﬁed, Category is the news topic, and LabelList\\nis a comma separated list of all unique labels for that language.\\nFor both models, we supply two example demonstrations per category from the training set. We\\nrandomly sample 100 samples from the test set for each language and evaluate on this. Both demon-\\nstrations and evaluation are done across two random seeds, such that we sample distinct demonstra-\\ntions and test samples for each language with each random seed. We report the average F1 score for\\neach language across both seeds. It should be noted that we decide to evaluate on a subset of the test\\nset because of the tedious nature of obtaining results ChatGPT.\\n3.3.2\\nMACHINE TRANSLATION\\nWe do not use Cohere for machine translation because its generation API currently supports only\\nEnglish14. ChatGPT is used for all our machine translation evaluations. Preliminary results from\\ncomparing few-shot to zero-shot translations on Nigerian Pidgin suggested no noticeable difference.\\nHence, we perform all translations in a zero-shot manner because of the tedious nature and low-\\nthroughput of obtaining results from ChatGPT.\\nWe use the prompt used in concurrent work (Jiao et al., 2023) which is shown below:\\nPlease provide the [TGT] translation for these sentences:\\n{Sentence}\\n{Sentence}\\nWhere T GT is the target language to be translated into, and Sentence is a sentence to be translated.\\nWe sample 100 sentences from the test set of each language and evaluate translating this to and from\\nEnglish. We report the BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) which is calculated using SacreBLEU\\n(Post, 2018).\\nIt has been shown that English prompts perform better, on average, than in-language prompts\\n(Lin et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2022), so we do not explore prompting in the target language for both\\ntasks.\\n4\\nRESULTS\\n4.1\\nTEXT CLASSIFICATION\\nResults are reported in table 1. As we can see, both commercial models fall well below the current\\nstate of the art. Surprisingly, Cohere’s multilingual embedding model is the worst performer, despite\\nsupporting almost all the languages evaluated on. Nigerian Pidgin has the highest score in the Cohere\\nresults. This is most likely as a result of its close linguistic relationship with English language, which\\nusually makes up a signiﬁcant portion of the pretraining corpora of pretrained language models\\n(Wenzek et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020; Laurenc¸on et al., 2022). ChatGPT is the best performing\\ncommercial model, and it gets above average F1 scores on all languages. Similar to Cohere, Hausa\\n14https://docs.cohere.ai/docs/generation-card#technical-notes\\n4\\nAfricaNLP workshop at ICLR2022\\nTable 1: Text Classiﬁcation Results: We report the F1 scores for the commercial models.

The details of ChatGPT’s pretraining corpora\\nand exact training methods are unknown, so it is hard to hypothesize a reason for its relatively\\ngood performance. However, it is very likely that its pretraining corpora contains non-English text.\\nFurthermore, multilinguality has been shown to be a part of possible emergent abilities of large\\nlanguage models (Wei et al., 2022b), so the performance is not entirely surprising. Overall, both\\ncommercial models fall signiﬁcantly short of the current state of the art. While ChatGPT is the\\nbetter performer, Cohere’s performance is especially surprising since it has been trained on almost\\nall of the evaluated languages15.\\n4.2\\nMACHINE TRANSLATION\\nResults are reported in table 2. ChatGPT has very poor performance on machine translation, ob-\\ntaining BLEU scores of less than 1.0 on all languages. This is very surprising given its good per-\\nformance on text classiﬁcation. Our results agree with concurrent work (Abott et al., 2023) which\\nﬁnds that GPT 3.5 obtains a BLEU score of 0 on Zulu to English translation. Our ﬁndings are\\nalso somewhat similar to (Jiao et al., 2023), which reports signiﬁcantly worse performance on Ro-\\nmanian, a relatively low-resource language, than on higher-resource languages like English and\\nGerman. While the BLEU scores are too low to draw conclusions from, ChatGPT seems to perform\\nbetter when translating into English than from it. This agrees with previous works (Belinkov et al.,\\n2017; Bugliarello et al., 2020) which show that it is harder to translate into morphologically rich\\nlanguages, like African ones, than morphologically poor ones like English. In general, our results\\nsuggest that ChatGPT is not good enough for translation involving African languages. It also sug-\\ngests that ChatGPT performs better on sequence classiﬁcation tasks than it does on text generation\\ntasks for African languages.\\n5\\nERROR ANALYSIS\\nWe take a closer look at some errors made by the model on machine translation. Speciﬁcally, we\\nfocus on two languages - Yoruba and Nigerian Pidgin - because they are understood by the authors.\\nFor each language, we randomly select 3 samples and discuss their predictions.\\n5.1\\nYORUBA TRANSLATIONS\\nSamples are shown in table 4. Looking at sample 1, ChatGPT mistranslates “B´ı omi b´a gb´on´a\\nju b´ı ´o s.e ye. lo.” which means “When water becomes too hot” to “Water is poured into the con-\\ntainer”. Furthermore, the English to Yoruba translation is completely wrong and riddled with a lot\\nof misspellings and grammatical errors. In sample 3, ChatGPT gets the translations wrong and also\\ntransposes the words “ob`ınrin” (woman) and “ok`unrin” (man) in the translations. One notable ob-\\nservation across English to Yoruba translations is that ChatGPT does not always include diacritics\\nin its Yoruba predictions. Overall, ChatGPT does a really poor job in translating in either direc-\\ntion. The hallucinatory nature of the model predictions is evident, as all translations barely have any\\ncorrelation with the original sentences.\\n15https://txt.cohere.ai/multilingual/\\n5\\nAfricaNLP workshop at ICLR2022\\nTable 2: Machine Translation Results: We report the BLEU scores of the translations from ChatGPT.\\nWe also report the current state of the art result obtained from Adelani et al. (2022)\\nand NLLB Team et al. (2022).

Looking at the Nigerian Pidgin sentences, we can see the language’s\\nlinguistic similarity with English. Interestingly, while the ChatGPT predictions yield low BLEU\\nscores, they are somewhat semantically similar to the ground truth. However, there notable errors\\nmade across board. For example, focusing on the Nigerian Pidgin to English predictions in sample\\n2, there are tense errors. Also, the model seems to misunderstand what “numbers” refers to in the\\ninput text, as its prediction indicates it confuses it for the number of goals. Furthermore, across\\nall samples, the model seems to be poor at translating certain English words to Nigerian Pidgin\\nwords, such as “The” to “Di”, so it always retains the original English word. In general, while the\\npredictions in both directions for all samples have notable issues, they are more semantically similar\\nto the ground truth than the BLEU scores suggests. This highlights the drawbacks of automatic\\nmetrics based on N-gram overlap.\\n6\\nCONCLUSION\\nWe have presented a preliminary analysis of commercial language models on African languages.\\nJoshi et al. (2020) note that over 90% of the world’s 7000+ languages are under-studied by the NLP\\ncommunity. Despite the 2000+ spoken languages and over 1 billion people in Africa16, its languages\\nmake up a signiﬁcant portion of the under-studied languages (Blasi et al., 2022). While there have\\nbeen several efforts (∀et al., 2020; Ahia & Ogueji, 2020b; Adelani et al., 2021; Ogueji et al., 2021;\\nNLLB Team et al., 2022; Alabi et al., 2022; Dossou et al., 2022; Adebara et al., 2022) to close this\\ngap, there is still a lot of work to be done. This is even more pertinent given the rapid commercial\\nadoption of large scale language models. Our ﬁndings suggest that these models do not perform\\nwell on African languages. In particular, there seems to be performance disparity, depending on the\\ntask evaluated. Although our work reports what is, to the best of our knowledge, the ﬁrst evaluation\\nof commercial language models on African languages, we note that this only a preliminary study\\nthat needs to be further advanced. Future works could focus on more advanced prompting methods\\nsuch as chain-of-thought (Wei et al., 2022c) and pivot prompting (Jiao et al., 2023), evaluation of\\nmore test samples and a wider variety of tasks. While our ﬁnding may be impacted by the sampled\\n16https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Africa\\n6\\nAfricaNLP workshop at ICLR2022\\nTable 3: Examples of Nigerian Pidgin translation using ChatGPT\\nSample 1\\nSample 2\\nSample 3\\nNigerian Pid-\\ngin Sentence\\nCommission head, Simon\\nByabakama,\\nassure\\ndi\\nnation on top live TV\\nfor\\nThursday\\nevening\\nafta polls don close say\\nresult don dey enter for\\ndi national tally centre\\ndespite\\ndi\\nnationwide\\ninternet blackout\\nDi goal be give Eyimba\\nsome hope as dem kontinu\\nto press for plunty nomba\\nto secure a point at least\\nNa im inauguartion be\\ndi ﬁrst time wey elected\\nleaders dey handova give\\neach oda for Niger history\\nfor over 60 years wey dem\\ndon get independence, but\\ndi attack from jihadist and\\nsome kind plan to do coup\\ndon spoil di celebrate.\\nEnglish Sen-\\ntence\\nCommission head, Simon\\nByabakama, assured the\\nnation on live TV on\\nThursday\\nevening\\nafter\\npolls closed that results\\nwere arriving at the na-\\ntional tally centre despite\\nthe\\nnationwide\\ninternet\\nblackout.\\nThe goal gave Enyimba\\nsome hope as they contin-\\nued to press in numbers to\\nat least secure a point\\nHis inauguration marks\\nthe\\nﬁrst\\nhandover\\nbe-\\ntween\\nelected\\nleaders\\nin Niger’s 60-year post-\\nindependence\\nhistory,\\nbut jihadist attacks and\\nan\\nalleged\\nattempted\\ncoup have overshadowed\\nceremonies.\\nChatGPT\\nTranslation\\nPcm→Eng\\nCommission head, Simon\\nByabakama, assured the\\nnation on live TV on\\nThursday\\nevening\\nafter\\nthe polls had closed that\\nthe results were entering\\nthe national tally center\\ndespite the nationwide in-\\nternet blackout.\\nThe goal was to give Ey-\\nimba some hope as they\\ncontinue to press for a suf-\\nﬁcient number of goals to\\nsecure at least one point.\\nThe inauguration marked\\nthe\\nﬁrst\\ntime\\nin\\nover\\n60 years of independence\\nthat elected leaders have\\nhanded\\npower\\nto\\neach\\nother in Niger’s history,\\nbut attacks by jihadists\\nand plans for a coup have\\ndisrupted the celebrations\\nChatGPT\\nTranslation\\nEng→Pcm\\nSimon Byabakama wey\\ndey head the Commis-\\nsion, e talk for TV on\\nThursday night after elec-\\ntion close say the result\\ndon dey reach the centre\\nwhere dem dey count the\\nresult even though inter-\\nnet all over the place dey\\ncut.\\nThe goal give Enyimba\\nsome hope as dem still\\ndey press wey full force to\\nﬁt get at least one point.\\nThe day wey dem swear\\nam\\nfor\\nofﬁce,\\nna\\nthe\\nﬁrst time wey leader wey\\nget vote go hand over to\\nanother leader since 60\\nyears after independence\\nfor Niger but the attacks\\nwey the bad people wey\\ndey carry gun dey do, and\\nthe way wey dem try put\\neye for the power no gree\\nam to happen make e no\\ndey sweet for the day.\\ntest data, the use of the BLEU automatic metric (Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Mathur et al., 2020;\\nFreitag et al., 2020), prompting template and prompting examples, it nonetheless presents a call-to-\\naction to ensure African languages are well represented in the age of commercial large language\\nmodels.\\n7\\nAfricaNLP workshop at ICLR2022\\nTable 4: Examples of Yoruba translation using ChatGPT\\nSample 1\\nSample 2\\nSample 3\\nYoruba Sen-\\ntence\\nB´ı omi b´a gb´on´a ju b´ı ´o s.e\\nye. lo.

Markov chains have long been used to model natural languages since their development by Russian mathematician Andrey Markov in the early 20th century. Markov published his first paper on the topic in 1906, and analyzed the pattern of vowels and consonants in the novel Eugeny Onegin using Markov chains. Once a Markov chain is learned on a text corpus, it can then be used as a probabilistic text generator.\\nComputers were needed to go beyond Markov chains. By the early 1970s, Harold Cohen was creating and exhibiting generative AI works created by AARON, the computer program Cohen created to generate paintings.\\nThe terms generative AI planning or generative planning were used in the 1980s and 1990s to refer to AI planning systems, especially computer-aided process planning, used to generate sequences of actions to reach a specified goal. Generative AI planning systems used symbolic AI methods such as state space search and constraint satisfaction and were a \"relatively mature\" technology by the early 1990s. They were used to generate crisis action plans for military use, process plans for manufacturing and decision plans such as in prototype autonomous spacecraft.\\n\\n\\n=== Generative neural nets (2014-2019) ===\\n\\nSince inception, the field of machine learning has used both discriminative models and generative models to model and predict data. Beginning in the late 2000s, the emergence of deep learning drove progress, and research in image classification, speech recognition, natural language processing and other tasks. Neural networks in this era were typically trained as discriminative models due to the difficulty of generative modeling.\\nIn 2014, advancements such as the variational autoencoder and generative adversarial network produced the first practical deep neural networks capable of learning generative models, as opposed to discriminative ones, for complex data such as images. These deep generative models were the first to output not only class labels for images but also entire images.\\nIn 2017, the Transformer network enabled advancements in generative models compared to older Long-Short Term Memory models, leading to the first generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), known as GPT-1, in 2018. This was followed in 2019 by GPT-2, which demonstrated the ability to generalize unsupervised to many different tasks as a '), Document(metadata={'title': 'Generative AI pornography', 'summary': 'Generative AI pornography or simply AI pornography is a digitally created pornography produced through generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.

These algorithms, including Generative adversarial network (GANs) and text-to-image models, generate lifelike images, videos, or animations from textual descriptions or datasets.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe use of generative AI in the adult industry began in the late 2010s, initially focusing on AI-generated art, music, and visual content. This trend accelerated in 2022 with Stability AI\\'s release of Stable Diffusion (SD), an open-source text-to-image model that enables users to generate images, including NSFW content, from text prompts using the LAION-Aesthetics subset of the LAION-5B dataset. Despite Stability AI\\'s warnings against sexual imagery, SD\\'s public release led to dedicated communities exploring both artistic and explicit content, sparking ethical debates over open-access AI and its use in adult media. By 2020, AI tools had advanced to generate highly realistic adult content, amplifying calls for regulation.\\n\\n\\n=== AI-generated influencers ===\\nOne application of generative AI technology is the creation of AI-generated influencers on platforms such as OnlyFans and Instagram. These AI personas interact with users in ways that can mimic real human engagement, offering an entirely synthetic but convincing experience. While popular among niche audiences, these virtual influencers have prompted discussions about authenticity, consent, and the blurring line between human and AI-generated content, especially in adult entertainment.\\n\\n\\n=== The growth of AI porn sites ===\\nBy 2023, websites dedicated to AI-generated adult content had gained traction, catering to audiences seeking customizable experiences. These platforms allow users to create or view AI-generated pornography tailored to their preferences. These platforms enable users to create or view AI-generated adult content appealing to different preferences through prompts and tags, customizing body type, facial features, and art styles. Tags further refine the output, creating niche and diverse content. Many sites feature extensive image libraries and continuous content feeds, combining personalization with discovery and enhancing user engagement. AI porn sites, therefore, attract those seeking unique or niche experiences, sparking debates on creativity and the ethical boundaries of AI in adult media.\\n\\n\\n== Ethical concerns and misuse ==\\nThe growth of generative AI pornography has also attracted some cause for criticism. AI technology can be exploited to create non-consensual pornographic material, posing risks similar to those seen with deepfake revenge porn and AI-generated NCII (Non-Consensual Intimate Image). A 2023 analysis found that 98% of deepfake videos online are pornographic, with 99% of the victims being women. Some famous celebrities victims of deepfake include Scarlett Johansson, Taylor Swift, and Maisie Williams.\\nOpenAI is exploring whether NSFW content, such as erotica, can be responsibly generated in age-appropriate contexts while maintaining its ban on deepfakes. This proposal has attracted criticism from child safety campaigners who argue it undermines OpenAI\\'s mission to develop \"safe and beneficial\" AI. Additionally, the Internet Watch Foundation has raised concerns about AI being used to generate sexual abuse content involving children.\\n\\n\\n=== AI-generated NCII (AI Undress) ===\\nSeveral US states are taking actions against using deepfake apps and sharing them on the internet. In 2024, San Francisco filed a landmark lawsuit to shut down \"undress\" apps that allow users to generate non-consensual AI nude images, citing violations of state laws. The case aligns with California\\'s recent legislation—SB 926, SB 942, and SB 981—championed by Senators Aisha Wahab and Josh Becker and signed b'), Document(metadata={'title': 'AI boom', 'summary': 'The AI boom is an ongoing period of rapid progress in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) that started in the late 2010s before gaining international prominence in late 2022 with the public release of ChatGPT.

This period is sometimes referred to as an AI spring, to contrast it with previous AI winters.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nIn 2012, a University of Toronto research team used artificial neural networks and deep learning techniques to lower the error rate below 25% for the first time during the ImageNet challenge for object recognition in computer vision. The event catalyzed the AI boom later that decade, when many alumni of the ImageNet challenge became leaders in the tech industry. In March 2016, AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol in a five-game match, marking the first time a computer Go program had beaten a 9-dan professional without handicap. This match led to significant increase in public interest in AI. The generative AI race began in earnest in 2016 or 2017 following the founding of OpenAI and earlier advances made in graphical processing units (GPUs), the amount and quality of training data, generative adversarial networks, diffusion models and transformer architectures. \\nIn 2018, the Artificial Intelligence Index, an initiative from Stanford University, reported a global explosion of commercial and research efforts in AI. Europe published the largest number of papers in the field that year, followed by China and North America. Technologies such as AlphaFold led to more accurate predictions of protein folding and improved the process of drug development. Economists and lawmakers began to discuss the potential impact of AI more frequently. By 2022, large language models (LLMs) saw increased usage in chatbot applications; text-to-image-models could generate images that appeared to be human-made; and speech synthesis software was able to replicate human speech efficiently.\\nAccording to metrics from 2017 to 2021, the United States outranks the rest of the world in terms of venture capital funding, the number of startups, and patents granted in AI. Scientists who have immigrated to the U.S. play an outsized role in the country\\'s development of AI technology. Many of them were educated in China, prompting debates about national security concerns amid worsening relations between the two countries.\\nExperts have framed AI development as a competition for economic and geopolitical advantage between the United States and China. In 2021, an analyst for the Council on Foreign Relations outlined ways that the U.S. could maintain its position amid progress made by China. In 2023, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies advocated for the U.S. to use its dominance in AI technology to drive its foreign policy instead of relying on trade agreements.\\n\\n\\n== Advances ==\\n\\n\\n=== Biomedical ===\\nThe AlphaFold 2 score of more than 90 in CASP\\'s global distance test (GDT) is considered a significant achievement in computational biology and great progress towards a decades-old grand challenge of biology. The structural biologist and Nobel Prize winner Venki Ramakrishnan called the result \"a stunning advance on the protein folding problem\", adding that \"It has occurred decades before many people in the field would have predicted.\"\\nThe ability to predict protein structures accurately based on the constituent amino acid sequence is expected to accelerate drug discovery and enable a better understanding of diseases.\\n\\n\\n=== Images and videos ===\\n\\nText-to-image models captured widespread public attention when OpenAI announced DALL-E, a transformer system, in January 2021. A successor capable of generating complex and realistic images, DALL-E 2, was unveiled in April 2022. An alternative text-to-image model, Midjourney, was released in July 2022.

By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.\\nMany of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.
